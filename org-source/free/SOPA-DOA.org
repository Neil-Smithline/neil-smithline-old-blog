TITLE:  SOPA DOA? Not Quite But Getting There
DESC:   In response to massive public outcries, SOPA looks like it will die or end up a bill with no teeth.

While not dead, SOPA is losing its teeth. Despite having had its major backer remove one of the more totalitarian portions from the bill (the ability to block non-US DNS addresses), SOPA appears unable to make progress in Congress. 

In a [[http://cnet.co/ArcHPH][CNET]] article (via [[http://bit.ly/zMTg3h][Slashdot]]), the [[wiki:RIAA][RIAA]] whines:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Instead of helping to come up with mechanisms to deny access to
    the U.S. market by foreign criminals," the RIAA wrote, "the
    opposition just keeps saying no. It is incumbent upon them to help
    develop language that will ensure that criminals can't access our
    market, while at the same time protecting our need for national
    cybersecurity.
#+END_QUOTE

As [[SOPA-the-end-of-free-speech.org][discussed previously]], SOPA claims to support American businesses while it really supports the very large media companies and stifles smaller companies and individuals rights to publish.

As I've stated in my previous [[SOPA-the-end-of-free-speech.org][posting about SOPA]], I am strongly opposed to [[wiki:Piracy of software][piracy]] as I am a software engineer (ie: software pays my rent). But I also believe that piracy can be dealt with without destroying [[wiki:Freedom_of_speech][free speech]]. My viewpoints are similar to those of the [[wiki:Electronic_Frontier_Foundation][EFF]] and differ from the [[wiki:Free_Software_Foundation][FSF]]'s viewpoint which opposes proprietary software altogether.
