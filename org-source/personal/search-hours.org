As you've likely heard, [[http://google.com][Google]] keeps a fair amount of stats about its users. You can see some of these statistics at https://www.google.com/history/trends. I have most of the stat tracking disabled but Google still tracks my searches.

While not perfect, my usage of Google roughly correlates with my computer usage. This is Google's record of what time of day I use Google:
[[/uploads/images/GoogleTrends.png]]

I like to think of this pattern of usage as the unemployed nerd, single-parent usage model. My most sustained computer use is 9 or 10pm until 3am. That's the time after my kids go to bed and before I go to sleep.

I assume you can guess my sleep hours from the table. If you're wondering how I get by on such little sleep, the answer is I like to take a 20-60 minute nap. Typically, this works best for me between 2 and 5pm. 

Being I tend to have a late breakfast, I lunch mid-afternoon and dinner late evening. That is seen by the 2pm and 8pm dips in usage as those are my meal times. While my Google searches drop at these times, I frequently am online, reading articles that I've queued up for reading later (ie: when I'm using my hands to eat and not type).

As I try to spend the evenings with my kids, there's a dip in the 7-9pm range.

My personal favorite is the 7am block with only a single Google search. Either I'm asleep at 7am or up for a special activity. Please note that /special/ doesn't necessarily mean I'm enjoying the activity, just that it is atypical.

To go along with my nerdy computer usage hours, Google also lists the top 10 sites I've accessed:
  # http://en.wikipedia.org
  # http://help.ubuntu.com
  # http://www.google.com
  # http://forum.xda-developers.com
  # http://www.emacswiki.org
  # http://code.google.com
  # http://ubuntuforums.org
  # http://www.apple.com
  # http://stackoverflow.com
  # http://www.amazon.com

If you exclude the [[http://en.wikipedia.org][Wikipedia]], [[http://google.com][Google]], and [[http://amazon.com][Amazon]] as general utility sites, then the remaining 7 sites are pretty hard-core nerd. One could argue that [[http://apple.com][Apple]] is not a nerd site, but the parts of it that I frequented were.

  # [[http://google.com/search?q=nih rickets][nih rickets]]
  # [[http://google.com/search?q=mythbuntu backend-setup h][mythbuntu backend-setup hangs]]

Here a full nine out of ten are nerd searches. The only exception is number 9 and that goes to the single-parent portion of the profile. These searches were due to me having a very ill son and, like a true nerd-parent, me extensively researching what was making him ill.

Lastly, it gives the 10 pages I've accessed from Google searches:
