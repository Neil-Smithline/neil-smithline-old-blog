Without any intent to opine about the use of NFC chips in phone, your concerns seem wholly unfounded.

I see no evidence to back your assertion that mobile phone companies are looking to get into the credit business. Phone manufacturers are installing NFC chips that companies such as Google Checkout, PayPal, Mastercard, and Visa will use to manage your account with them. Not your mobile carrier account.

Perhaps articles such as http://bit.ly/zKs6YB as well as http://bit.ly/zZU1Dj and http://bit.ly/xYdWq7, from the PCMag.com website, are wrong or incomplete? Or perhaps you just didn't do your homework and published false statements about the use of NFC in mobile phones based on incorrect assumptions that you made?

While many comments add value to the story they discuss, this comment seems to discredit your story. I believe a retraction or rewrite is in order.
