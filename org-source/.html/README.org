README

* WTF Is This File?
This is the README file for the /.txt/ or /.html/ directory. Duh! :-)

* WTF Is This Directory?
Better question. Emacs' NanoBlogger org mode exports /.html/ files as /.txt/ files. If things go wrong, sometimes the files are exported with the incorrect name of just /.txt/, or even /.html/, rather than /myfile.txt/. Being you cannot overwrite a directory with a file, this directory will cause Emacs' NanoBlogger code to produce an error rather than generate a file named /.txt/ or /.html/.
