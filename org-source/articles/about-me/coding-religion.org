* Technical Religious Beliefs
Individuals, teams, companies, and even cross-company development projects such as a 3^rd-party implementing a plug-in should be produced in the most efficient, reusable, and maintainable manner. This includes:
- Reusing or adding parameters to code rather than copying-and-pasting.
- Applications should strictly enforce boundaries based on layering, packages, objects, etc...
- The use of appropriate tools, interaction models, programming languages, documentation practices, and other technical choices.
- Most importantly, business requirements should be made with full knowledge of the technical cost and take precedence over technical best-practices.
