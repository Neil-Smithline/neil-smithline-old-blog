[[http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net][NanoBlogger]] supports [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28metadata%29][tags]]. While they came working out of the box,
their UI is a bit awkward. I now have it so that I can easily tag
entries with just a single command line. For example, I'll tag this
posting by typing: 
#+BEGIN_CODE
nbeta about-this-blogs-tech 1
#+END_CODE
=nbeta= is my shell script to add tags to an entry. It seems a bit
hard to remember but:
|---------+-------------+----------------------------------------------|
| Letters | Word        | Meaning                                      |
|---------+-------------+----------------------------------------------|
| nb      | NanoBlogger | This is a NanoBlogger command                |
| e       | Entry       | This command will affect one or more entries |
| t       | Tags        | Affects the tags, in this case, of entries   |
| a       | Add         | We'll be adding tags                         |
|---------+-------------+----------------------------------------------|

=about-this-blogs-tech= is the tag name. =1= is the entry ID number.
I'd like it to be the entry name but that isn't done yet and seems of
lower priority as the newest entry is always entry #1.
