README

* WTF Is This File?
This is the README file for the /.txt/, /.org/, or /.html/ directory. Duh! :-)

* WTF Is This Directory?
Better question. Emacs' NanoBlogger Org Mode should export only /.txt/ files but, when I break it, can also export /.html/ and /.org/ files. If things go very wrong, sometimes the files are exported with the just as a suffix (eg: the filename is /.txt/). 

Besides being non-functional, it is hard to notice as dot-files are typically hidden. But most OSes do not let you overwrite a directory with a file. For example, if there is a directory called /\/foo\/bar/ is a directory, an error will occur if you try to create a regular file called /\/foo\/bar/.

As I find error messages much easier to track than dot-files, I have created these directories in several locations in the NB blog to help me catch things I have broken.
