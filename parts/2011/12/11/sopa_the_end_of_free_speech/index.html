	<h3 class="title">SOPA: The End Of Free Speech</h3>
	

<p> 
<a href="https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8173">SOPA</a>, and its sister bill PROTECT-IP, are currently making their way
through congress. I have pointers to some of the excellent sources of
information on the bills at the end of this article.
</p>
<p>
While the magnitude of these bills is staggering, this posting focuses
on how the passage of these bills will dramatically remove the ability
of individuals to produce and share content on the internet.
</p>
<p>
While I favor reasonable enforcement and punishment of internet-based
crimes, these bills introduce the concepts of:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Guilty until proven innocent</b> 
</li>
<li><b>Guilty by association</b> 
</li>
<li><b>Whoopsy daisy legal recourse</b> that restricts damages (eg: going bankrupt) due to abuse of SOPA to
  "s&mdash; happens" response.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
into American law. At least to me, those concepts don't seem very
"American".
</p>
<p>
The problems with this bill can best be demonstrated by a simple
example. Let us use the consider a fictitious, non-profit website run
by a couple of friends that is focused on internet freedom. The
website is called <i>Big Brother, Back-off and Stop-It!</i> with the URL
BBBandS.org.
</p>
<p>
If this bill is passed, <i>Big Brothers Big Sisters</i> (<a href="http://bbbs.org">http://bbbs.org</a>)
could simply write a letter to search engines such as Google, content
distributors such as Facebook, and payment companies such as Paypal,
claiming that they feel BBBandS.org is infringing on their <i>domain name</i>. Once this is done, <i>each</i> search, content, and payment provider
must contact BBBandS.org (remember that BBBandS.org is a couple of
friends working out of their garage).
</p>
<p>
BBBandS.org must reply to each and every provider explaining why they
do not feel that BBBandS.org is infringing on BBBS.org's <i>domain name</i>. It seems clear that BBBandS.org could not accomplish this task
in a timely fashion.
</p>
<p>
For each company that BBBandS.org does not manage to provide a
credible counterclaim to (where <i>credible</i> is determined by the
search, content, and payment provider companies), a fairly mechanical
process will begin where federal courts will execute a <i>cease and desist</i> to each search, content, or payment service provider
informing them that they must stop servicing BBBandS.org.
</p>
<p>
<b>Guilty until proven innocent:</b> Note that the
simple lack of a timely response to sufficient to, by means of a
judicial <i>cease and desist</i> order, force search, and payment providers to
become legally and financially liable if they continue to do business
with BBBandS.org. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Guilty by association:</b> Whether a service provider agrees or disagrees
with the order, they can be held accountable if they do not "block
access to or end financial affiliation" with BBBandS.org.
</p>
<p>
To add insult to injury, the bill goes on to provide "immunity from
liability for service providers" that follow a <i>cease and desist</i>
order, causing clear economic harm to BBBandS.org, <b>even</b> if it is
eventually determined that there was no infringement.
</p>
<p>
<b>Whoopsy daisy legal recourse</b>: Should the <i>cease and desist</i> order
be determined to be incorrect via a legal process that may take years
and cost more money than most people will ever have, this bill
restricts BBBandS.org's legal recourse to accepting the apologies of
the US judicial system.
</p>
<p>
While I am in favor of what the bill claims to be protecting, this
bill proposes far too high a price to pay for that protection.
</p>
<p>
If you care about the rights of small organizations (eg: people like you), please:
</p><ul>
<li>Read an excellent summary of SOPA in this <a href="https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8173">article</a>. Keep in mind
    that the reason that the article seems ludicrous, insane, and
    unbelievable is because it is accurately reflecting the proposed
    legislation.
</li>
<li>Google <i>SOPA</i> or <i>PROTECT-IP</i>.
</li>
<li>Take action via Mozilla's page <a href="http://bit.ly/tvIpE3">focused on this issue</a>.
</li>
<li>Take action via the <a href="https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8173">EFF</a>.
</li>
<li>Contact your legislator using <a href="http://bit.ly/s0I5me">this</a> <a href="#OpenCongress.org">OpenCongress.org</a> page (takes
    only a minute or so).
</li>
<li>Discuss this issue with everyone you know.
</li>
<li>Discuss this issue with people you don't know. I recommend "So what do you think
    about SOPA?" as a pick-up line though I encourage creativity and
    individualism as to the exact wording.
</li>
<li>Post a copy or a link to one or more articles on SOPA everywhere
    you can.
</li>
</ul>
