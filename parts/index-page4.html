<p>
Earlier this week, the Florida appeals court made a ruling that even the poster of a defamatory posting on a public website could not force a website to remove the posting. While most sites allow you to remove your own postings, <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/">RipoffReport.com</a>, the site involved in this ruling, states that as an advocate of free speech, it never removes reports. This is clearly stated at the top of their home page and documented extensively on their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripoff_Report#Non-removal_Policy">Wikipedia page</a>. 
</p>
<p>
While not allowing the poster to remove or have removed a posting seems extreme, the site claims that it wishes to remain unbiased. As such, it makes no judgment calls about its content. Everything that is appropriate for the site will stay on the site, forever. RipoffReport.com is afraid that posters may be pressured by 3<sup>rd</sup>-parties to remove articles. As such, They are simply not allowed to.
</p>
<p>
While postings are never removed, the site allows anyone to post a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuttal">rebuttal</a> to any posting. A poster can use this mechanism to retract their initial statement. 
</p>
<p>
The court ruled that RipoffReport.com could neither be held liable for the defamatory posting nor be forced to remove it. The bottom line of all of this is that
</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<p>The supreme court of Florida, a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/125066/State-States.aspx">middle-of-the-road state</a>, was willing to make a controversial ruling favored many aspects of freedom of speech. If SOPA is passed, cases like this won't even make it to courts as SOPA make it clear that if a ruling is defamatory, it is illegal.
</p>
</div>

<p>
While Congress has delayed voting on SOPA for another month, it is still on the docket. It is unclear what the fate of SOPA will be. 
</p>
<p>
One can hope that Congress pays attention to protests such as the statement]] consumers sent to <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> after it announced its support of SOPA. GoDaddy announced that on a Saturday (see <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/12/29/2053252/wikipedia-to-dump-godaddy-over-sopa">more complete chronology</a>) and then lost <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/12/25/1452251/go-daddy-loses-over-21000-domains-in-one-daylosing">21K domains</a> on the next day. More recently, the <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/12/29/2053252/wikipedia-to-dump-godaddy-over-sopa">Wikipedia announced it would discontinue all use of GoDaddy</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Let's continue to hope that advocates of free speech, including you (see <a href="SOPA-the-end-of-free-speech.html#ID-06BB29E4-D6B3-430E-B5A3-FDC6716A0ED3">SOPA: The End Of Free Speech</a> for instructions as to how to help), continue to pressure our government into sane activit

</p><blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/">RipoffReport.com</a> contained an admittedly defamatory posting, by one of its users, about a person who operated a Florida corporation providing addiction treatment services. Although the site was asked by the poster herself to remove the post, it refused. A Florida appeals court has ruled that the site is absolutely immune from suit (<a href="http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2011/12/florida-appeals-court-rules.html">pdf</a>), and cannot even be directed to remove the offending post, since under the [[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode47/usc<sub>sec</sub><sub>47</sub><sub>00000230</sub>-&mdash;000-.html][Communications Decency Act (47 USC 230)] 'no cause of action may be brought' against a provider of an "interactive computer service" based upon information provided by a 3rd party.

                  The Litigious Trio
              </a>

<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->

<p>
This posting is best viewed as part of the series of postings about <a href="http://neilsmithline.com/archives/litigious-trio/index.html">The Litigious Trio</a> and, in a larger context, <a href="http://neilsmithline.com/archives/online-freedom/index.html">Online Freedom</a>.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, <i>The Litigious Trio</i> are, in alphabetical order, <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> and <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. While they are three wonderful technology companies, over time, each has turned to an increasingly large amount of litigation to enforce their current market status.
</p>
<p>
While I do not believe that the three companies actively collaborate with each other to hinder the success of smaller companies, I believe that selfish<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> business practices by the trio have had the affect of having created a three company monopoly<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. While the three companies are locked in a near-endless stream of litigation against each other, this is rather typical amongst large corporate competitors. I can't say that I'm in favor of such litigation but I the three companies can spend their money that way if they want to. They have more than enough of it.
</p>
<p>
But when <i>The Litigious Trio</i>, behaving in a pseudo-monopolistic manner, use litigation to block competition from smaller companies, they end up stifling innovation. 
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, <i>The Litigious Trio</i> are not necessarily the most user-friendly companies. They, along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>, are some of the leaders in gathering information about its users. Consider the following:
</p><ul>
<li>Nearly all of Google's revenue comes from advertising. Their advertising is so valuable, and profitable, because they are able to sell well targeted ads. That is, they know so much about each user that they can sell ad space for that specific user for more than other advertising vendors. The article, <a href="http://www.globalreports.com/?article=12">We Are Google's Products</a>, provides a good summary of this concept. 
</li>
<li>Google has a near-monopoly on internet advertising. The US Senate <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/12/21/1356246/senators-recommend-ftc-perform-antitrust-investigation-of-google">has recently requested</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission">FTC</a> to investigate this.
</li>
<li>Microsoft's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft+antitrust&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&amp;client=firefox-a">monopolistic practices</a> have been discussed and challenged by courts around the world for years.
</li>
<li>Apple is currently under investigation for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/07/us-justice-department-apple-ebooks_n_1134983.html">price fixing on its eBooks</a>, has just been fined for <a href="http://www.pluggedin.co.uk/article/apple-fined-over-misleading-customers-italy">charging customers in Italy</a> for providing federally mandated, free support, and has tried to <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/story/11/08/09/1832254/sale-of-samsung-galaxy-tab-blocked-in-the-eu">destroy Samsung's mobile market</a> by presenting <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/08/15/1758224/flawed-evidence-in-eu-apple-vs-samsung-case">falsified evidence</a> to courts around the world. While this last claim seems hard to believe, an <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/238047/apple_offers_flawed_evidence_in_lawsuit_against_samsung.html">easily accessible description and images</a> demonstrate that Apple is either incompetent or dishonest.
</li>
</ul>



<p>
The only question seems to be whether the public is motivated to address this problem and what the public can do to address it. The reason monopolies are illegal is because fighting them is difficult.
