                  Seems It Really Works

<p> 
Well, it appears this actually does work. I seem to be having a few
issues integrating with <a href="http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net">NanoBlogger</a> but I'm sure I'll work those out.
The problems that I've seen are:
</p><ol>
<li>It seems that adding or even updating a new entry is as costly
       as rebuilding the entire blog from scratch. Right now, that's
       OK. But what am I going to do when I have 10, or 100 postings?
       I hope NanoBlogger can handle this.
</li>
<li>NB seems to assume that its input files are hand-written in
       some legacy text editor called <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> or something :-). While my
       strategy of using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>' <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> keeps the flavor of NB in
       that it is written in a simple markup language, it doesn't seem
       to fit the NB model perfectly. There is nothing wrong with NB's
       markup, it is just that Org Mode's markup can easily be
       exported to virtually every other markup on the planet. So I
       just need to learn Org Mode markup, write my content in Org
       Mode, and then publish that data into whatever format I choose.
       Seems a better solution but NB isn't quite prepared for it.
</li>
<li>I would still like better integration with Org Mode and NB. The
       steps I've used to produce this entry are:
<ul>
<li>Ran a little shell script I wrote to create a new NB
             entry. All I do is give the shell script the title of the
             Org Mode file I want to store the new entry in and it
             does its magic, leaving me with an Org Mode skeleton for
             NB.
</li>
<li>Edit the Org Mode file just created.
</li>
<li>Use Org Mode to publish the entry. This just stores it in
            my local NB folder.
</li>
<li>Run <code>nb update</code> to have my changes put into the local
            copy of the blog.
</li>
<li>Run <code>nb preview</code> to view the changes before publishing.
</li>
<li>Run <code>nb publish</code> to update my blog.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ol>


<p>
So, while they're are still some problems,  I have to say I love it.
The advantages of using Org Mode and the simple NB blogging engine on
both my local and production server is way cool.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> is actually way cool. I've only started using it in the past
year and will likely spend years learning it as it supports so many
features. But, like all well-designed pieces of software, you don't
need to learn it all at once. I'll yabber about Org Mode another day.
In any case, I'm real happy with my blog and the ease with which I can
add postings to it.

<p> 
My hope is that I can write this entry in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>' <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> and have it auto-published into this <a href="http://www.neilsmithline.com">blog</a>. If you are reading this, then I have succeeded.
</p>
<p>
This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website#Static_website">static blog</a>. That is, the server side is all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>. It can be served by virtually any web server. This makes it incredibly convenient for testing and deploying. When I am writing blog entries, I'm just typing in Emacs. I then save the entries and use Org Mode plus some personalized tweaks to <a href="http://orgmode.org/org.html#Publishing">publish</a> them to a local directory as something close to HTML.
</p>
<p>
These HTMLish files are then fed into <a href="http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net">NanoBlogger</a>. NanoBlogger is the magic tool that turns a few HTMLish files into a fully functional website. NanoBlogger accepts HTML for the text af entries but wants some simply formatted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> added to the file.
</p>
<p>
The Metadata is needed to help NanoBlogger out because, as its name implies, is a teeny-tiny blog engine. As a comparison, my installation of NanoBlogger is 768K (yes, that's "K"). I also have installations of Drupal at (14M) and Joomla (107M). 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.txt">.txt</a> source for each NanoBlogger posting is a file with the body of the entry in HTML embedded but all the cruft that tends to come before and after the body of a web page is simply not there. The easiest way to get an understanding of it is to view the <a href="http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/articles/example.txt">metadata source</a> for this <a href="http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/articles/example/">sample posting</a>.
</p>
<p>
So you're saying "Big deal." or "Who needs yet another file format?" But it is a big deal. What most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younglings#Ranks_of_Jedi">younglings</a> have never learned is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> is a distraction from actual content production. Content production is not the same as formatting and editing and, at least in my experience, uses very different parts of the brain. So the less formatting you do while producing content, the better your content will be (at least if you have my brain :-).
</p>
<p>
While it has largely been lost with the popularization of the <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, initially, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cheatsheet">Wiki markup</a> was intended to simplify editing but also served to separate the content production from formatting. While NanoBlogger expects these HTMLish files as input, it is designed to generate them from any number of simpler input formats.
</p>
<p>
These simpler input formats are quite unlike HTML as they are, well they're simpler. The default input format is the rather famous <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> though many other formats are supported by NanoBlogger or the community. This <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/use-markdown-for-easy-web-writing.html">article</a> seems to do a good job explaining the benefits of simple languages such as Markdown.
</p>
<p>
It took me but a few hours to create a converter for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>' <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> to NanoBlogger.
</p>
<p>
While not nearly as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_(aesthetic)">cool</a> as what I've discussed above NanoBlogger has yet another advantage: it produces a static site. On my local machine (<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP546">17" MacBook Pro</a>), I can view the entire site without running a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web server</a>. I simply go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">Firefox</a> (actually <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/">Firefox Aurora</a>) and visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URL</a>, specifically, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_url">file URL</a> of my blog. For me, I visit <code>file://Users/neil/www-nb</code>, and then I can see my entire blog through the magic of a static websites, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_url">file URLs</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_URL#Absolute_and_relative_URLs">relative URLs</a>.
