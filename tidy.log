URIs must be properly escaped, they must not contain unescaped
characters below U+0021 including the space character and not
above U+007E. Tidy escapes the URI for you as recommended by
HTML 4.01 section B.2.1 and XML 1.0 section 4.2.2. Some user agents
use another algorithm to escape such URIs and some server-sided
scripts depend on that. If you want to depend on that, you must
escape the URI by your own. For more information please refer to

The table summary attribute should be used to describe
the table structure. It is very helpful for people using
non-visual browsers. The scope and headers attributes for
table cells are useful for specifying which headers apply
to each table cell, enabling non-visual browsers to provide
a meaningful context for each cell.

The table summary attribute should be used to describe
the table structure. It is very helpful for people using
non-visual browsers. The scope and headers attributes for
table cells are useful for specifying which headers apply
to each table cell, enabling non-visual browsers to provide
a meaningful context for each cell.

URIs must be properly escaped, they must not contain unescaped
characters below U+0021 including the space character and not
above U+007E. Tidy escapes the URI for you as recommended by
HTML 4.01 section B.2.1 and XML 1.0 section 4.2.2. Some user agents
use another algorithm to escape such URIs and some server-sided
scripts depend on that. If you want to depend on that, you must
escape the URI by your own. For more information please refer to
http://www.w3.org/International/O-URL-and-ident.html
