Interpreting this chart from <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/survey-new-u-s-smartphone-growth-by-age-and-income/">Nielsen</a> (via <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/02/smartphone-buying-machine/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+wired/index+(Wired:+Index+3+(Top+Stories+2))">Wired</a>) does not require any great amount of effort.

</p>
</div>

<p>
It can be summarized by any of the following sentences:
</p><ul>
<li>The greater your income the more likely you are to have a smartphone.
</li>
<li>Young adults are more likely to have smartphones than older adults.
</li>
<li>Smartphones are only for the young and get outgrown by the old. (Nah! But it is a valid interpretation of th e chart.)
</li>
</ul>


<p>
But I think the graph can best be summarized by:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><b>Smartphones are where it is at today; and tomorrow, even more so.</b>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Perhaps not the best grammar but I think it gets the point across. It becomes even more dramatic when you look at the number of people who have acquired smartphones in the past three months:

As <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059968/quotes">Robin</a> would <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)#.22Holy_.......2C_Batman.21.22">say</a>: Holy <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ubiquitous+computing?qsrc=2446">ubiquitous computing</a>, Batman!
</p>
<p>
It seems clear that this is where the money is. This means that some subset of technologies such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html5">HTML5</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuality_(computing)">virtual computing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadoop">Hadoop</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">AWS</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couchdb">CouchDB</a>, to name just a few, are going to be the technologies of tomorrow.

As a diehard nerd, I'm thrilled to have lived through these technical revolutions. Not only have I lived through them, but I've had the honor of having been an early consumer and even helped develop some of them. So, with great joy, and without trying to sound too greedy, I am joyous that the next revolutionary wave is coming to shore. And it is called <i>ubiquitous computing</i>.

<![CDATA[<!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->

<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->

<p>
As I've discussed in previous <a href="http://www.neilsmithline.com/archives/blog">postings about this blog's technology</a>, this is a static blog written with NanoBlogger. NanoBlogger is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a> driven blogging system. Alas, I have found the <a href="http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/docs/nanoblogger.html">NanoBlogger manual</a> to be difficult to follow and the syntax of the CLI to be non-intuitive. (See the footnote <a href="https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/nbc">here</a> regarding the existing CLI.) On the upside, NanoBlogger is a CLI system which makes it easy to modify. 
</p>
<p>
I started out with a few small helper scripts, eventually merging them into a single helper script. As I was using that script and learning more about NanoBlogger, I found myself writing smaller helper scripts for my big helper script. Eventually, I was never calling my original, large helper script directly.
</p>
<p>
At this point it became clear that some refactoring was needed. So I refactored. I came up with a single shell script call <i>nbc.sh</i> that does all the work and a series of shell scripts that simply call nbc.sh.
</p>
<p>
The key idea behind nbc.sh, or simply <i>nbc</i>, is that the scripts that call it are trivial. By "trivial" I mean that each script is only a few lines long, all the side scripts have identical content, and, if not for the semantics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>, would simply be multiple symbolic links to the same program.
</p>
<p>
As you can see below, the code for the side scripts simply stores the command name, <i>$0</i>, of the side script that was called and then calls the <i>nbc.sh</i> script that is in the same directory as the side script. 
</p>


<pre class="example">#!/bin/sh

# Code to load include file.
ORIG_ARG_0="$0"
NBDIR=${0%/*}
. ${NBDIR}/nbc.sh
</pre>

<p>
This means that as I continue to add functionality to nbc, all I need to do is copy one of the side scripts to the filename of the new command I added. 
</p>
<p>
While I won't discuss the exact naming scheme used for these side scripts in detail in this posting, I will say that I have tried to systematic in how the scripts are named. Once you learn a few abbreviations (eg: "e" for "Entry" or "Entries", "u" for "Update") and the rules for combining those abbreviations (standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation">RPN</a>), you will know the names of all the commands, what each command does, and the type and order of arguments each command takes.
</p>
<p>
I still need to write richer documentation for nbc and its side scripts, but I can finish this posting off with some concrete examples.
</p>
<p>
NB supports an "update" command that essentially tells NB to rebuild the blog from scratch. The syntax of this command is:
</p>


<pre class="example">nb update
</pre>

<p>
My nbc version of this command is:
</p>


<pre class="example">nbu
</pre>

<p>
All of the commands for nbc start with the letters "nb". The letter "U" is the abbreviation for "Update". So "nbu" tells nb to run the update command. As I said, the code for nbu and the other side scripts are trivial and given above. As far as examples go, nbu is not very exciting. But the nbc's CLI for creating tags is a bit more exciting.
</p>
<p>
NB's syntax for creating tags, as documented in its manual, is:
</p>


<pre class="example">nb --title &lt;tag-name&gt; add tag
</pre>

<p>
Gosh! That's both tough to remember and tough to type. In nbc, the command for adding a tag is <i>nbga</i>. All commands start with "nb". After that, the "g" means that we are talking about "taGs". The "a" stands for "Add". The syntax for the command is 
</p>


<pre class="example">nbga &lt;tag list&gt;
</pre>


<p>
Besides being much easier to type and remember, it allows a tag list as compared to a single tag name. That is, you can create multiple tags in a single command rather than needing to call nb once for each new tag.
</p>
<p>
In NBC, a tag list is a comma-separated list of one or more tag names. So "tag1" is a tag list and "tag1,tag2,tag3" is also a tag list. If you prefer you can space-separate the tag list but you need to ensure that you pass the entire tag list as the first argument to nbga. 
</p>
<p>
As the operations become more complex, NBC's simplifications become greater and more obvious. My next posting about NBC will discuss some of these simplifications.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to use NBC, look at the source code, or tell me why NBC sucks, you can get the scripts at <a href="https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/nbc">https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/nbc</a>.

<title>This Blog Is Now Hosted For Free (and it's slashdot proof too)</title>

<![CDATA[<!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->

<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->

<p>
While there are many free or nearly free blog hosting sites available, most of them come with a long list of restrictions. Either they restrict you to using their blogging software, throw ads on your pages, give you the "unlimited bandwidth" plan that they'll cut off if your site gets too much traffic, limit you to only the ugly themes, etc&hellip; 
</p>
<p>
But <a href="http://www.neilsmithline.com">www.neilsmithline.com</a> is now hosted on a site that charges me nothing, doesn't put ads on my pages, couldn't care less about the theme I use, and, should I ever be lucky enough, survive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotting">slashdotting</a>. The only restriction is that my blog has to be static. Being that I already had a static blog (see <a href="#about-this-blogs-tech.org">previous posting</a>), this was no problem for me at all. I've used lots of dynamic blogs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla">Joomla</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogger</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type">Movable Type</a>, etc&hellip;) and just found that "dynamic" is a short way of saying that the blogging system is going to do what it wants and not what I want.
</p>
<p>
Along with the free hosting I get automatic version control, well-managed collaboration (not that I have any collaborators), data redundancy, eternal archiving (I probably won't need it that long but it's nice to know that nothing will get lost), and the ability to get a copy of my data onto my local machine whenever I want it.
</p>
<p>
My choice of blogging technology was largely influenced by these two blog postings, <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/further-jekyll-notes">1</a> and <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/moved-to-jekyll">2</a>, and email conversations I had with their author, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/about">Les Orchard</a>. While Les went with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, I preferred the simpler <a href="http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/">NanoBlogger</a>. Les uses <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> for versioning his blog but hosts his blog on his own site as he wants full control of what is published. I simply couldn't agree with him more. 
</p>
<p>
When I moved to my new blogging framework, I quickly got my blog up and running using NanoBlogger for site generation and sftp to publish it to my VPS. Today I investigated replacing sftp with Github and its notification framework. This would essentially mirror Les's blog system except that I am running NanoBlogger locally while he runs Jekyll. 
</p>
<p>
As I was investigating using Github for transportation and archiving of my blog, I decided to take another look at <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. And then, like a lightning bolt, it occurred to me. When I publish my blog by pushing it to Github, if the repository has the magic name of <i>neil-smithline.github.com</i>, then Github would publish my blog at <a href="http://neil-smithline.github.com/">http://neil-smithline.github.com/</a> automatically. There simply was no benefit to serve my blog from my VPS as Github would do it far better than I could on my VPS.
</p>
<p>
The only problem I foresee is that I run more than just my blog on <a href="http://www.nelismithline.com">www.neilsmithline.com</a>. But the other applications I run are only for my private use so I can just map them to another sub-domain such as <i>whatever.neilsmithline.com</i>. For example, I've been playing with a cloud-based bookmarking system, <a href="http://www.phoboslab.org/projects/asaph">Asaph</a>, that allows you to run your own cloud bookmark server. But I can access it at and, if you have an interest, can view it at: <a href="http://www2.neilsmithline.com/asaph/">http://www2.neilsmithline.com/asaph/</a>.
</p>
<p>
All-in-all, it's like a nerd's dream come true :-D
</p>
<p>
<b>UPDATED: Sat Feb 11 13:12:02 EST 2012</b>
<br/>
There seems to be another problem with hosting my blog on Github. While practically all of Github requires SSL, there appears to be no way to get a Github hosted website to use SSL. Thinking about it, the task seems inherently difficult. Github makes all of its sources file public but you must protect your site's SSL private key. Currently, all site information is stored in the Github repository. A private SSL key could only be added if Github updated their configuration to allow the key to be stored out-of-band (ie: not in the repository).

<![CDATA[<!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->

<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->

<p>
I was reading about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting">SL4A</a>, also known as <a href="http://android.com">Android</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">Scripting Languages</a>. They are a set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_and_dirty">quick-and-dirty</a> ports of programming languages to the Android that interact with the Android <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">OS</a>. I just stumbled upon this "<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/issues/detail?id=184">issue page</a>" (it's more like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">forum</a> than a bug report). 
</p>
<p>
The developer is trying to run something on his Android, which is basically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, that requires <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser">superuser</a> permissions. As the responses started to build upon each other, one user suggested starting his shell script with the following lines (the actual posting was in Android's flavor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> but I've converted it to <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/su">bash(1)</a> to make it more accessible):
</p>



<pre class="example">#!/bin/sh
if [ "$USER" != "root" ]; then
    exec sudo $SHELL -c "`cat /proc/$$/cmdline | tr '\000' ' '`" root
fi
</pre>


<p>
I simply couldn't help being entertained at how revolting yet simply brilliant that code is. I hate when I run a command and it behaves stupidly because I didn't run it as the correct user. For example, this is the output of running <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get">apt-get(8)</a> without proper permission:
</p>



<pre class="example">$ apt-get install foobar
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
</pre>


<p>
So I have to rerun the command with <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo">sudo(8)</a>? I guess that makes sense in some situations but it grates on my nerves. Including the above lines in your shell scripts will automatically run commands as root when you need root privileges. It will also do this without bypassing the security of sudo. That is, if you don't have permission to run a command with sudo, then this won't help.

Despite the plain hackery of the above code, I expanded upon it, making it a full shell script utility. You can look the code or grab a copy at my <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/Neil-Smithline">page</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/rerunasroot">rerunasroot</a> repository.

I stumbled upon <a href="http://bit.ly/Ad2VZd">this article</a> in the Wikipedia about an annual 22-mile cross-country race where the participants are people running and people riding horses. After 25-years the first runner won the race. In the subsequent half-dozen years there have been several more human winners. 
</p>
<p>
I feel bad for any runner that is drafting a horse when the horse's tail goes up&hellip;

While not dead, SOPA is losing its teeth. Despite having had its major backer remove one of the more totalitarian portions from the bill (the ability to block non-US DNS addresses), SOPA appears unable to make progress in Congress. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="http://cnet.co/ArcHPH">CNET</a> article (via <a href="http://bit.ly/zMTg3h">Slashdot</a>), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA">RIAA</a> whines:
</p><blockquote>

<p>Instead of helping to come up with mechanisms to deny access to
the U.S. market by foreign criminals," the RIAA wrote, "the
opposition just keeps saying no. It is incumbent upon them to help
develop language that will ensure that criminals can't access our
market, while at the same time protecting our need for national
cybersecurity.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
As <a href="#SOPA-the-end-of-free-speech.org">discussed previously</a>, SOPA claims to support American businesses while it really supports the very large media companies and stifles smaller companies and individuals rights to publish.
</p>
<p>
As I've stated in my previous <a href="#SOPA-the-end-of-free-speech.org">posting about SOPA</a>, I am strongly opposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy of software">piracy</a> as I am a software engineer (ie: software pays my rent). But I also believe that piracy can be dealt with without destroying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech">free speech</a>. My viewpoints are similar to those of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation">EFF</a> and differ from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation">FSF</a>'s viewpoint which opposes proprietary software altogether.
