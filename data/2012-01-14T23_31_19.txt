<p>
I stumbled upon <a href="http://bit.ly/Ad2VZd">this article</a> in the Wikipedia about an annual 22-mile cross-country race where the participants are people running and people riding horses. After 25-years the first runner won the race. In the subsequent half-dozen years there have been several more human winners.

<p>
I feel bad for any runner that is drafting a horse when the horse's tail goes up&hellip;
