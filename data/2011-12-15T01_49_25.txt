TITLE:      Sparkleshare: Maybe An Open, Privately Hosted, Dropbox Alternative
AUTHOR:     Neil Smithline

DESC:       Sparkleshare is an up-and-coming Dropbox alternative that is ready, or nearly ready, for real use.

BODY:


<p> 
<a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> took the internet by storm with its free storage and ease of
access. But Dropbox comes with a limited amount of data, a level of
secureness that is hard-to-understand, and rather proprietary.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://sparkleshare.org">Sparkleshare</a> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software">open source</a> alternative to Dropbox that hit my
radar screen about 6 months ago. I played with it a bit back then but
it didn't seem to be quite there. I think I was using an early-alpha,
pre-release version so I this was to be expected.
</p>
<p>
I gave it another try earlier this week and seem to be pretty happy
with it. Some of the things I like about it include:
</p><ol>
<li>I get to host it on my own server. This means the data is
     private. I own it. Nobody else has a copy of it. Etc&hellip;
</li>
<li>I have been renting a Linux <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> from <a href="http://rosehosting.com">RoseHosting.com</a> ($20/month)
     for many years so they provide me with a convenient, managed, and
     relatively secure place to host Sparkleshare.
</li>
<li>It only took me about 5 minutes to install and configure
     sparkleshare on my Linux VPS. Not because I'm brilliant but
     because Linux doesn't suck and Sparkleshare requires no special
     server software. Just a few standard packages such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> and a
     copy-and-paste of one command line. The client install (Mac OS X)
     was equally simple.
</li>
<li>Being that it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software">FOSS</a>, there is continual scrutiny of the source
     code to maintain quality and security.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
The only real objection I have with it is that Dropbox allows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symbolic links</a> in the Dropbox folder so I don't need to have all of my files in
one directory. I haven't yet gotten this to work on Sparkleshare.
Either I just haven't figured it out, someone else will add it
shortly, or, being it is <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/Foss">FOSS</a>, I'll add it if I get motivated enough
(BTW: I'm voting for someone else implementing it).
