Just thought I'd add a list of my patents as of Tue Feb 21, 2012:
</p><ul>
<li>US Patent #7,979,891: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/7979891">Method and System for Securing Execution of Untrusted Applications</a>, July 2011
   This patent, in combination with 7,814,556 defines a model for enforcing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2ee">J2EE</a> (a.k.a: JEE) application security via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandboxing</a> within a single Java VM.
</li>
<li>US Patent #7,814,556: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/7814556">System and Method for Protecting APIs from Untrusted or Less Trusted Applications</a>, October 2010xo
   See patent 7,979,891 immediately above.
</li>
<li>US Patent #7,610,813: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/7610613">Servlet Authentication Filters</a>, October 2009
  An extension of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2ee">J2EE</a> (a.k.a: JEE) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Servlet">Servlets</a> model that provides an integrated and pluggable model for authentication for Servlets. <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=196">JSR-196</a> extended the ideas introduced in this patent so that the concepts are now a standard part of J2EE.
</li>
<li>US Patent #7,487,207: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/7487207">System and method for determining the functionality of a software application based on nodes within the software application and transitions between the nodes</a>, February 2009
  Defines a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller">model-view-controller</a> (MVC) model for implementing web applications. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Struts">Apache Struts</a> is based on the ideas defined in this patent.
</li>
<li>US Patent #7,051,069: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/7051069">System for managing logical process flow in an online environment</a>, May 2006
  Earlier version of 7,487,207 immediately above.
</li>
<li>US Patent application pending #20,060,031,855: <a href="http://bit.ly/20060031855">System and Method for Runtime Interface Versioning</a>, February 2006
  The concepts embodied in this patent application have been used to ensure backwards compatibility for WebLogic Server's Security <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Provider_Interface">SPI</a>s. The implementation of this patent allows the server to continue to add new functionality to the SPIs while maintaining forwards compatibility for security. As of January 2012, all security providers written since 2002 are compatible with the newest server version. Any <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/apirefs.1211/e24391/weblogic/security/spi/package-summary.html">current security SPI class</a> ending with "V2" is utilizing the design model in this patent.
</li>
<li>US Patent #5,787,447: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/5787447">Memory allocation maintaining ordering across multiple heaps</a>, July 1998
  A memory allocation algorithm that supported incremental modification of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF executables</a>, while maintaining the ordering required by ELF as well as existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)">Solaris</a> tools (eg: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dbx_(debugger)">dbx</a>) without requiring restarting of the application or the tools.
</li>
</ul>
