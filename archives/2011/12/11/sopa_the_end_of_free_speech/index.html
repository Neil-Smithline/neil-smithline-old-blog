<h3 class="title">SOPA: The End Of Free Speech</h3>
<p><a href=
"https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8173">
SOPA</a>, and its sister bill PROTECT-IP, are currently making
their way through congress. I have pointers to some of the
excellent sources of information on the bills at the end of this
article.</p>
<p>While the magnitude of these bills is staggering, this posting
focuses on how the passage of these bills will dramatically remove
the ability of individuals to produce and share content on the
internet.</p>
<p>While I favor reasonable enforcement and punishment of
internet-based crimes, these bills introduce the concepts of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Guilty until proven innocent</b></li>
<li><b>Guilty by association</b></li>
<li><b>Whoopsy daisy legal recourse</b> that restricts damages (eg:
going bankrupt) due to abuse of SOPA to "sâ€” happens" response.</li>
</ul>
<p>into American law. At least to me, those concepts don't seem
very "American".</p>
<p>The problems with this bill can best be demonstrated by a simple
example. Let us use the consider a fictitious, non-profit website
run by a couple of friends that is focused on internet freedom. The
website is called <i>Big Brother, Back-off and Stop-It!</i> with
the URL BBBandS.org.</p>
<p>If this bill is passed, <i>Big Brothers Big Sisters</i>
(<a href="http://bbbs.org">http://bbbs.org</a>) could simply write
a letter to search engines such as Google, content distributors
such as Facebook, and payment companies such as Paypal, claiming
that they feel BBBandS.org is infringing on their <i>domain
name</i>. Once this is done, <i>each</i> search, content, and
payment provider must contact BBBandS.org (remember that
BBBandS.org is a couple of friends working out of their
garage).</p>
<p>BBBandS.org must reply to each and every provider explaining why
they do not feel that BBBandS.org is infringing on BBBS.org's
<i>domain name</i>. It seems clear that BBBandS.org could not
accomplish this task in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>For each company that BBBandS.org does not manage to provide a
credible counterclaim to (where <i>credible</i> is determined by
the search, content, and payment provider companies), a fairly
mechanical process will begin where federal courts will execute a
<i>cease and desist</i> to each search, content, or payment service
provider informing them that they must stop servicing
BBBandS.org.</p>
<p><b>Guilty until proven innocent:</b> Note that the simple lack
of a timely response to sufficient to, by means of a judicial
<i>cease and desist</i> order, force search, and payment providers
to become legally and financially liable if they continue to do
business with BBBandS.org.</p>
<p><b>Guilty by association:</b> Whether a service provider agrees
or disagrees with the order, they can be held accountable if they
do not "block access to or end financial affiliation" with
BBBandS.org.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, the bill goes on to provide "immunity
from liability for service providers" that follow a <i>cease and
desist</i> order, causing clear economic harm to BBBandS.org,
<b>even</b> if it is eventually determined that there was no
infringement.</p>
<p><b>Whoopsy daisy legal recourse</b>: Should the <i>cease and
desist</i> order be determined to be incorrect via a legal process
that may take years and cost more money than most people will ever
have, this bill restricts BBBandS.org's legal recourse to accepting
the apologies of the US judicial system.</p>
<p>While I am in favor of what the bill claims to be protecting,
this bill proposes far too high a price to pay for that
protection.</p>
<p>If you care about the rights of small organizations (eg: people
like you), please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read an excellent summary of SOPA in this <a href=
"https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8173">
article</a>. Keep in mind that the reason that the article seems
ludicrous, insane, and unbelievable is because it is accurately
reflecting the proposed legislation.</li>
<li>Google <i>SOPA</i> or <i>PROTECT-IP</i>.</li>
<li>Take action via Mozilla's page <a href=
"http://bit.ly/tvIpE3">focused on this issue</a>.</li>
<li>Take action via the <a href=
"https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8173">
EFF</a>.</li>
<li>Contact your legislator using <a href=
"http://bit.ly/s0I5me">this</a> <a href=
"#OpenCongress.org">OpenCongress.org</a> page (takes only a minute
or so).</li>
<li>Discuss this issue with everyone you know.</li>
<li>Discuss this issue with people you don't know. I recommend "So
what do you think about SOPA?" as a pick-up line though I encourage
creativity and individualism as to the exact wording.</li>
<li>Post a copy or a link to one or more articles on SOPA
everywhere you can.</li>
</ul>
