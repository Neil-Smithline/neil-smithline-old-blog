<h3 class="title">The Litigious Trio</h3>
<!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>This posting is best viewed as part of the series of postings
about <a href=
"http://neilsmithline.com/archives/litigious-trio/index.html">The
Litigious Trio</a> and, in a larger context, <a href=
"http://neilsmithline.com/archives/online-freedom/index.html">Online
Freedom</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, <i>The Litigious Trio</i> are, in alphabetical
order, <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href=
"http://google.com">Google</a> and <a href=
"http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. While they are three
wonderful technology companies, over time, each has turned to an
increasingly large amount of litigation to enforce their current
market status.</p>
<p>While I do not believe that the three companies actively
collaborate with each other to hinder the success of smaller
companies, I believe that selfish<sup><a class="footref" name=
"fnr.1" href="#fn.1" id="fnr.1">1</a></sup> business practices by
the trio have had the affect of having created a three company
monopoly<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2" id=
"fnr.2">2</a></sup>. While the three companies are locked in a
near-endless stream of litigation against each other, this is
rather typical amongst large corporate competitors. I can't say
that I'm in favor of such litigation but I the three companies can
spend their money that way if they want to. They have more than
enough of it.</p>
<p>But when <i>The Litigious Trio</i>, behaving in a
pseudo-monopolistic manner, use litigation to block competition
from smaller companies, they end up stifling innovation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <i>The Litigious Trio</i> are not necessarily the
most user-friendly companies. They, along with <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>, are some of
the leaders in gathering information about its users. Consider the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly all of Google's revenue comes from advertising. Their
advertising is so valuable, and profitable, because they are able
to sell well targeted ads. That is, they know so much about each
user that they can sell ad space for that specific user for more
than other advertising vendors. The article, <a href=
"http://www.globalreports.com/?article=12">We Are Google's
Products</a>, provides a good summary of this concept.</li>
<li>Google has a near-monopoly on internet advertising. The US
Senate <a href=
"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/12/21/1356246/senators-recommend-ftc-perform-antitrust-investigation-of-google">
has recently requested</a> the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission">FTC</a> to
investigate this.</li>
<li>Microsoft's <a href=
"https://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft+antitrust&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&amp;client=firefox-a">
monopolistic practices</a> have been discussed and challenged by
courts around the world for years.</li>
<li>Apple is currently under investigation for <a href=
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/07/us-justice-department-apple-ebooks_n_1134983.html">
price fixing on its eBooks</a>, has just been fined for <a href=
"http://www.pluggedin.co.uk/article/apple-fined-over-misleading-customers-italy">
charging customers in Italy</a> for providing federally mandated,
free support, and has tried to <a href=
"http://apple.slashdot.org/story/11/08/09/1832254/sale-of-samsung-galaxy-tab-blocked-in-the-eu">
destroy Samsung's mobile market</a> by presenting <a href=
"http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/08/15/1758224/flawed-evidence-in-eu-apple-vs-samsung-case">
falsified evidence</a> to courts around the world. While this last
claim seems hard to believe, an <a href=
"http://www.pcworld.com/article/238047/apple_offers_flawed_evidence_in_lawsuit_against_samsung.html">
easily accessible description and images</a> demonstrate that Apple
is either incompetent or dishonest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only question seems to be whether the public is motivated to
address this problem and what the public can do to address it. The
reason monopolies are illegal is because fighting them is
difficult.</p>
