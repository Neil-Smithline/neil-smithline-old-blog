<h3 class="title">This Blog Is Now Hosted For Free (and it's
slashdot proof too)</h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>While there are many free or nearly free blog hosting sites
available, most of them come with a long list of restrictions.
Either they restrict you to using their blogging software, throw
ads on your pages, give you the "unlimited bandwidth" plan that
they'll cut off if your site gets too much traffic, limit you to
only the ugly themes, etc…</p>
<p>But <a href="http://neilsmithline.com">neilsmithline.com</a> is
now hosted on a site that charges me nothing, doesn't put ads on my
pages, couldn't care less about the theme I use, and, should I ever
be lucky enough, survive <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotting">slashdotting</a>. The
only restriction is that my blog has to be static. Being that I
already had a static blog (see <a href=
"#about-this-blogs-tech.org">previous posting</a>), this was no
problem for me at all. I've used lots of dynamic blogs (<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal">Drupal</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress">WordPress</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla">Joomla</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogger</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type">Movable
Type</a>, etc…) and just found that "dynamic" is a short way of
saying that the blogging system is going to do what it wants and
not what I want.</p>
<p>Along with the free hosting I get automatic version control,
well-managed collaboration (not that I have any collaborators),
data redundancy, eternal archiving (I probably won't need it that
long but it's nice to know that nothing will get lost), and the
ability to get a copy of my data onto my local machine whenever I
want it.</p>
<p>My choice of blogging technology was largely influenced by these
two blog postings, <a href=
"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/further-jekyll-notes">1</a>
and <a href=
"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/moved-to-jekyll">2</a>, and
email conversations I had with their author, <a href=
"https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/about">Les
Orchard</a>. While Les went with <a href=
"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, I preferred the
simpler <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/">NanoBlogger</a>. Les uses
<a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> for versioning his blog
but hosts his blog on his own site as he wants full control of what
is published. I simply couldn't agree with him more.</p>
<p>When I moved to my new blogging framework, I quickly got my blog
up and running using NanoBlogger for site generation and sftp to
publish it to my VPS. Today I investigated replacing sftp with
Github and its notification framework. This would essentially
mirror Les's blog system except that I am running NanoBlogger
locally while he runs Jekyll.</p>
<p>As I was investigating using Github for transportation and
archiving of my blog, I decided to take another look at <a href=
"http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. And then, like a
lightning bolt, it occurred to me. When I publish my blog by
pushing it to Github, if the repository has the magic name of
<i>neil-smithline.github.com</i>, then Github would publish my blog
at <a href=
"http://neil-smithline.github.com/">http://neil-smithline.github.com/</a>
automatically. There simply was no benefit to serve my blog from my
VPS as Github would do it far better than I could on my VPS.</p>
<p>The only problem I foresee is that I run more than just my blog
on <a href="http://nelismithline.com">nelismithline.com</a>. But
the other applications I run are only for my private use so I can
just map them to another sub-domain such as
<i>whatever.neilsmithline.com</i>. For example, I've been playing
with a cloud-based bookmarking system, <a href=
"http://www.phoboslab.org/projects/asaph">Asaph</a>, that allows
you to host the bookmarks. You can see it at <a href=
"http://www2.neilsmithline.com/asaph/">http://www2.neilsmithline.com/asaph/</a>
if you have an interest in seeing the service in action.</p>
<p>All-in-all, it's like a nerd's dream come true :-D</p>

<h3 class="title">Nastiest Hack I've Seen In Awhile</h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>I was reading about <a href=
"http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting">SL4A</a>, also known
as <a href="http://android.com">Android</a> <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">Scripting
Languages</a>. They are a set of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_and_dirty">quick-and-dirty</a>
ports of programming languages to the Android that interact with
the Android <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">OS</a>. I just
stumbled upon this "<a href=
"http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/issues/detail?id=184">issue
page</a>" (it's more like a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">forum</a> than a bug
report).</p>
<p>The developer is trying to run something on his Android, which
is basically <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, that requires
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser">superuser</a>
permissions. As the responses started to build upon each other, one
user suggested starting his shell script with the following lines
(the actual posting was in Android's flavor of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>
but I've converted it to <a href=
"http://linux.die.net/man/1/su">bash(1)</a> to make it more
accessible):</p>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$USER" != "root" ]; then
    exec sudo $SHELL -c "`cat /proc/$$/cmdline | tr '\000' ' '`" root
fi
</pre>
<p>I simply couldn't help being entertained at how revolting yet
simply brilliant that code is. I hate when I run a command and it
behaves stupidly because I didn't run it as the correct user. For
example, this is the output of running <a href=
"http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get">apt-get(8)</a> without proper
permission:</p>
<pre class="example">
$ apt-get install foobar
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
</pre>
<p>So I have to rerun the command with <a href=
"http://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo">sudo(8)</a>? I guess that makes
sense in some situations but it grates on my nerves. Including the
above lines in your shell scripts will automatically run commands
as root when you need root privileges. It will also do this without
bypassing the security of sudo. That is, if you don't have
permission to run a command with sudo, then this won't help.</p>
<p>Despite the plain hackery of the above code, I expanded upon it,
making it a full shell script utility. You can look the code or
grab a copy at my <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> <a href=
"https://github.com/Neil-Smithline">page</a> in the <a href=
"https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/rerunasroot">rerunasroot</a>
repository.</p>
