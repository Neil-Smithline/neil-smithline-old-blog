<p>Interpreting this chart from <a href=
"http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/survey-new-u-s-smartphone-growth-by-age-and-income/">
Nielsen</a> (via <a href=
"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/02/smartphone-buying-machine/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+wired/index+(Wired:+Index+3+(Top+Stories+2))">

<p>It can be summarized by any of the following sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The greater your income the more likely you are to have a
smartphone.</li>
<li>Young adults are more likely to have smartphones than older
adults.</li>
<li>Smartphones are only for the young and get outgrown by the old.
(Nah! But it is a valid interpretation of th e chart.)</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think the graph can best be summarized by:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><b>Smartphones are where it is at today; and tomorrow, even more
so.</b></p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps not the best grammar but I think it gets the point
across. It becomes even more dramatic when you look at the number
of people who have acquired smartphones in the past three
months:</p>

<dd>Personal computers introduced computing to the public. When I
was in school, I would get bonus points for typing my homework

<dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_wide_web">The

<dd>The web, for the first time ever, connected the back office
directly to consumers in the comfort of their own home. ATMs
allowed you to get 24x7 access to your bank account, but you needed
to be at an ATM. PCs gave you access to many digital technologies,
but having multiple computers interact was difficult, slow, and
frequently expensive. But throw in the web and suddenly:
<b>BOOM!</b> You have the <a href=

<p>As a diehard nerd, I'm thrilled to have lived through these
technical revolutions. Not only have I lived through them, but I've
had the honor of having been an early consumer and even helped
develop some of them. So, with great joy, and without trying to
sound too greedy, I am joyous that the next revolutionary wave is
coming to shore. And it is called <i>ubiquitous computing</i>.</p>

<div class="blogbody">
<h3 class="title">New NanoBlogger Command-Line</h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>As I've discussed in previous <a href=
"http://www.neilsmithline.com/archives/blog">postings about this
blog's technology</a>, this is a static blog written with
NanoBlogger. NanoBlogger is a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a>
driven blogging system. Alas, I have found the <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/docs/nanoblogger.html">NanoBlogger
manual</a> to be difficult to follow and the syntax of the CLI to
be non-intuitive. (See the footnote <a href=
"https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/nbc">here</a> regarding the
existing CLI.) On the upside, NanoBlogger is a CLI system which
makes it easy to modify.</p>
<p>I started out with a few small helper scripts, eventually
merging them into a single helper script. As I was using that
script and learning more about NanoBlogger, I found myself writing
smaller helper scripts for my big helper script. Eventually, I was
never calling my original, large helper script directly.</p>
<p>At this point it became clear that some refactoring was needed.
So I refactored. I came up with a single shell script call
<i>nbc.sh</i> that does all the work and a series of shell scripts
that simply call nbc.sh.</p>
<p>The key idea behind nbc.sh, or simply <i>nbc</i>, is that the
scripts that call it are trivial. By "trivial" I mean that each
script is only a few lines long, all the side scripts have
identical content, and, if not for the semantics of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>, would simply
be multiple symbolic links to the same program.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the code for the side scripts simply
stores the command name, <i>$0</i>, of the side script that was
called and then calls the <i>nbc.sh</i> script that is in the same
directory as the side script.</p>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh

# Code to load include file.
ORIG_ARG_0="$0"
NBDIR=${0%/*}
. ${NBDIR}/nbc.sh
</pre>
<p>This means that as I continue to add functionality to nbc, all I
need to do is copy one of the side scripts to the filename of the
new command I added.</p>
<p>While I won't discuss the exact naming scheme used for these
side scripts in detail in this posting, I will say that I have
tried to systematic in how the scripts are named. Once you learn a
few abbreviations (eg: "e" for "Entry" or "Entries", "u" for
"Update") and the rules for combining those abbreviations (standard
<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation">RPN</a>),
you will know the names of all the commands, what each command
does, and the type and order of arguments each command takes.</p>
<p>I still need to write richer documentation for nbc and its side
scripts, but I can finish this posting off with some concrete
examples.</p>
<p>NB supports an "update" command that essentially tells NB to
rebuild the blog from scratch. The syntax of this command is:</p>
<pre class="example">
nb update
</pre>
<p>My nbc version of this command is:</p>
<pre class="example">
nbu
</pre>
<p>All of the commands for nbc start with the letters "nb". The
letter "U" is the abbreviation for "Update". So "nbu" tells nb to
run the update command. As I said, the code for nbu and the other
side scripts are trivial and given above. As far as examples go,
nbu is not very exciting. But the nbc's CLI for creating tags is a
bit more exciting.</p>
<p>NB's syntax for creating tags, as documented in its manual,
is:</p>
<pre class="example">
nb --title &lt;tag-name&gt; add tag
</pre>
<p>Gosh! That's both tough to remember and tough to type. In nbc,
the command for adding a tag is <i>nbga</i>. All commands start
with "nb". After that, the "g" means that we are talking about
"taGs". The "a" stands for "Add". The syntax for the command is</p>
<pre class="example">
nbga &lt;tag list&gt;
</pre>
<p>Besides being much easier to type and remember, it allows a tag
list as compared to a single tag name. That is, you can create
multiple tags in a single command rather than needing to call nb
once for each new tag.</p>
<p>In NBC, a tag list is a comma-separated list of one or more tag
names. So "tag1" is a tag list and "tag1,tag2,tag3" is also a tag
list. If you prefer you can space-separate the tag list but you
need to ensure that you pass the entire tag list as the first
argument to nbga.</p>
<p>As the operations become more complex, NBC's simplifications
become greater and more obvious. My next posting about NBC will
discuss some of these simplifications.</p>
<p>If you wish to use NBC, look at the source code, or tell me why
NBC sucks, you can get the scripts at <a href=

<h3 class="title">This Blog Is Now Hosted For Free (and it's
slashdot proof too)</h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>While there are many free or nearly free blog hosting sites
available, most of them come with a long list of restrictions.
Either they restrict you to using their blogging software, throw
ads on your pages, give you the "unlimited bandwidth" plan that
they'll cut off if your site gets too much traffic, limit you to
only the ugly themes, etc…</p>
<p>But <a href=
"http://www.neilsmithline.com">www.neilsmithline.com</a> is now
hosted on a site that charges me nothing, doesn't put ads on my
pages, couldn't care less about the theme I use, and, should I ever
be lucky enough, survive <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotting">slashdotting</a>. The
only restriction is that my blog has to be static. Being that I
already had a static blog (see <a href=
"#about-this-blogs-tech.org">previous posting</a>), this was no
problem for me at all. I've used lots of dynamic blogs (<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal">Drupal</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress">WordPress</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla">Joomla</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogger</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type">Movable
Type</a>, etc…) and just found that "dynamic" is a short way of
saying that the blogging system is going to do what it wants and
not what I want.</p>
<p>Along with the free hosting I get automatic version control,
well-managed collaboration (not that I have any collaborators),
data redundancy, eternal archiving (I probably won't need it that
long but it's nice to know that nothing will get lost), and the
ability to get a copy of my data onto my local machine whenever I
want it.</p>
<p>My choice of blogging technology was largely influenced by these
two blog postings, <a href=
"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/further-jekyll-notes">1</a>
and <a href=
"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/moved-to-jekyll">2</a>, and
email conversations I had with their author, <a href=
"https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/about">Les
Orchard</a>. While Les went with <a href=
"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, I preferred the
simpler <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/">NanoBlogger</a>. Les uses
<a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> for versioning his blog
but hosts his blog on his own site as he wants full control of what
is published. I simply couldn't agree with him more.</p>
<p>When I moved to my new blogging framework, I quickly got my blog
up and running using NanoBlogger for site generation and sftp to
publish it to my VPS. Today I investigated replacing sftp with
Github and its notification framework. This would essentially
mirror Les's blog system except that I am running NanoBlogger
locally while he runs Jekyll.</p>
<p>As I was investigating using Github for transportation and
archiving of my blog, I decided to take another look at <a href=
"http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. And then, like a
lightning bolt, it occurred to me. When I publish my blog by
pushing it to Github, if the repository has the magic name of
<i>neil-smithline.github.com</i>, then Github would publish my blog
at <a href=
"http://neil-smithline.github.com/">http://neil-smithline.github.com/</a>
automatically. There simply was no benefit to serve my blog from my
VPS as Github would do it far better than I could on my VPS.</p>
<p>The only problem I foresee is that I run more than just my blog
on <a href=
"http://www.nelismithline.com">www.neilsmithline.com</a>. But the
other applications I run are only for my private use so I can just
map them to another sub-domain such as
<i>whatever.neilsmithline.com</i>. For example, I've been playing
with a cloud-based bookmarking system, <a href=
"http://www.phoboslab.org/projects/asaph">Asaph</a>, that allows
you to run your own cloud bookmark server. But I can access it at
and, if you have an interest, can view it at: <a href=

<p>All-in-all, it's like a nerd's dream come true :-D</p>

There seems to be another problem with hosting my blog on Github.
While practically all of Github requires SSL, there appears to be
no way to get a Github hosted website to use SSL. Thinking about
it, the task seems inherently difficult. Github makes all of its
sources file public but you must protect your site's SSL private
key. Currently, all site information is stored in the Github
repository. A private SSL key could only be added if Github updated
their configuration to allow the key to be stored out-of-band (ie:
not in the repository).</p>

<h3 class="title">Nastiest Hack I've Seen In Awhile</h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>I was reading about <a href=
"http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting">SL4A</a>, also known
as <a href="http://android.com">Android</a> <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">Scripting
Languages</a>. They are a set of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_and_dirty">quick-and-dirty</a>
ports of programming languages to the Android that interact with
the Android <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">OS</a>. I just
stumbled upon this "<a href=
"http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/issues/detail?id=184">issue
page</a>" (it's more like a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">forum</a> than a bug
report).</p>
<p>The developer is trying to run something on his Android, which
is basically <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, that requires
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser">superuser</a>
permissions. As the responses started to build upon each other, one
user suggested starting his shell script with the following lines
(the actual posting was in Android's flavor of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>
but I've converted it to <a href=
"http://linux.die.net/man/1/su">bash(1)</a> to make it more
accessible):</p>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$USER" != "root" ]; then
    exec sudo $SHELL -c "`cat /proc/$$/cmdline | tr '\000' ' '`" root
fi
</pre>
<p>I simply couldn't help being entertained at how revolting yet
simply brilliant that code is. I hate when I run a command and it
behaves stupidly because I didn't run it as the correct user. For
example, this is the output of running <a href=
"http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get">apt-get(8)</a> without proper
permission:</p>
<pre class="example">
$ apt-get install foobar
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
</pre>
<p>So I have to rerun the command with <a href=
"http://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo">sudo(8)</a>? I guess that makes
sense in some situations but it grates on my nerves. Including the
above lines in your shell scripts will automatically run commands
as root when you need root privileges. It will also do this without
bypassing the security of sudo. That is, if you don't have
permission to run a command with sudo, then this won't help.</p>
<p>Despite the plain hackery of the above code, I expanded upon it,
making it a full shell script utility. You can look the code or
grab a copy at my <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> <a href=
"https://github.com/Neil-Smithline">page</a> in the <a href=
"https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/rerunasroot">rerunasroot</a>
repository.</p>
