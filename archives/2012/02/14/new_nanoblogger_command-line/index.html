<!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>As I've discussed in previous <a href=
"http://www.neilsmithline.com/archives/blog">postings about this
blog's technology</a>, this is a static blog written with
NanoBlogger. NanoBlogger is a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a>
driven blogging system. Alas, I have found the <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/docs/nanoblogger.html">NanoBlogger
manual</a> to be difficult to follow and the syntax of the CLI to
be non-intuitive. On the upside, NanoBlogger is a CLI system which
makes it easy to modify.</p>
<p>I started out with a few small helper scripts, eventually
merging them into a single helper script. As I was using that
script and learning more about NanoBlogger, I found myself writing
smaller helper scripts for my big helper script. Eventually, I was
never calling my original, large helper script directly.</p>
<p>At this point it became clear that some refactoring was needed.
So I refactored. I came up with a single shell script call
<i>nbc.sh</i> that does all the work and a series of shell scripts
that simply call nbc.sh.</p>
<p>The key idea behind nbc.sh, or simply <i>nbc</i>, is that the
scripts that call it are trivial. By "trivial" I mean that each
script is only a few lines long, all the side scripts have
identical content, and, if not for the semantics of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>, would simply
be multiple symbolic links to the same program.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the code for the side scripts simply
stores the command name, <i>$0</i>, of the side script that was
called and then calls the <i>nbc.sh</i> script that is in the same
directory as the side script.</p>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh

# Code to load include file.
ORIG_ARG_0="$0"
NBDIR=${0%/*}
. ${NBDIR}/nbc.sh
</pre>
<p>This means that as I continue to add functionality to nbc, all I
need to do is copy one of the side scripts to the filename of the
new command I added.</p>
<p>While I won't discuss the exact naming scheme used for these
side scripts in detail in this posting, I will say that I have
tried to systematic in how the scripts are named. Once you learn a
few abbreviations (eg: "e" for "Entry" or "Entries", "u" for
"Update") and the rules for combining those abbreviations (standard
<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation">RPN</a>),
you will know the names of all the commands, what each command
does, and the type and order of arguments each command takes.</p>
<p>I still need to write richer documentation for nbc and its side
scripts, but I can finish this posting off with some concrete
examples.</p>
<p>NB supports an "update" command that essentially tells NB to
rebuild the blog from scratch. The syntax of this command is:</p>
<pre class="example">
nb update
</pre>
<p>My nbc version of this command is:</p>
<pre class="example">
nbu
</pre>
<p>All of the commands for nbc start with the letters "nb". The
letter "U" is the abbreviation for "Update". So "nbu" tells nb to
run the update command. As I said, the code for nbu and the other
side scripts are trivial and given above. As far as examples go,
nbu is not very exciting. But the nbc's CLI for creating tags is a
bit more exciting.</p>
<p>NB's syntax for creating tags, as documented in its manual,
is:</p>
<pre class="example">
nb --title &lt;tag-name&gt; add tag
</pre>
<p>Gosh! That's both tough to remember and tough to type. In nbc,
the command for adding a tag is <i>nbga</i>. All commands start
with "nb". After that, the "g" means that we are talking about
"taGs". The "a" stands for "Add". The syntax for the command is</p>
<pre class="example">
nbga &lt;tag list&gt;
</pre>
<p>Besides being much easier to type and remember, it allows a tag
list as compared to a single tag name. That is, you can create
multiple tags in a single command rather than needing to call nb
once for each new tag.</p>
<p>In NBC, a tag list is a comma-separated list of one or more tag
names. So "tag1" is a tag list and "tag1,tag2,tag3" is also a tag
list. If you prefer you can space-separate the tag list but you
need to ensure that you pass the entire tag list as the first
argument to nbga.</p>
<p>As the operations become more complex, NBC's simplifications
become greater and more obvious. My next posting about NBC will
discuss some of these simplifications.</p>
<p>If you wish to use NBC, look at the source code, or tell me why
NBC sucks, you can get the scripts at <a href=
