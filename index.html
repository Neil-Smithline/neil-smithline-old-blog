<p>Interpreting this chart from <a href=
"http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/survey-new-u-s-smartphone-growth-by-age-and-income/">
Nielsen</a> (via <a href=
"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/02/smartphone-buying-machine/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+wired/index+(Wired:+Index+3+(Top+Stories+2))">
Wired</a>) does not require any great amount of effort.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p>It can be summarized by any of the following sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The greater your income the more likely you are to have a
smartphone.</li>
<li>Young adults are more likely to have smartphones than older
adults.</li>
<li>Smartphones are only for the young and get outgrown by the old.
(Nah! But it is a valid interpretation of th e chart.)</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think the graph can best be summarized by:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><b>Smartphones are where it is at today; and tomorrow, even more
so.</b></p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps not the best grammar but I think it gets the point
across. It becomes even more dramatic when you look at the number
of people who have acquired smartphones in the past three
months:</p>

<p>It seems clear that this is where the money is. This means that

just a few, are going to be the technologies of tomorrow.</p>
<p>In my lifetime, I have seen computers revolutionize society in
several different ways.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="#Http-en.wikipedia.org-wiki-Back_office">Back

<dd>Back office computerization led to the popularization of

online marketplace we are familiar with today.</dd>
<dt><a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer">Personal

<dd>Personal computers introduced computing to the public. When I
was in school, I would get bonus points for typing my homework
assignments. Today, homework assignments must be printed from a

processor</a> if not submitted electronically.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_wide_web">The
web</a></dt>
<dd>The web, for the first time ever, connected the back office
directly to consumers in the comfort of their own home. ATMs
allowed you to get 24x7 access to your bank account, but you needed
to be at an ATM. PCs gave you access to many digital technologies,
but having multiple computers interact was difficult, slow, and
frequently expensive. But throw in the web and suddenly:
<b>BOOM!</b> You have the <a href=

</dl>
<p>As a diehard nerd, I'm thrilled to have lived through these
technical revolutions. Not only have I lived through them, but I've
had the honor of having been an early consumer and even helped
develop some of them. So, with great joy, and without trying to
sound too greedy, I am joyous that the next revolutionary wave is
coming to shore. And it is called <i>ubiquitous computing</i>.</p>
<p>I don't claim to be the <a href=

hope that I get a chance to <a href="http://bit.ly/zN6qBU">surf the

NanoBlogger Command-Line</a></h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>As I've discussed in previous <a href=
"http://www.neilsmithline.com/archives/blog">postings about this
blog's technology</a>, this is a static blog written with
NanoBlogger. NanoBlogger is a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a>
driven blogging system. Alas, I have found the <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/docs/nanoblogger.html">NanoBlogger
manual</a> to be difficult to follow and the syntax of the CLI to
be non-intuitive. (See the footnote <a href=
"https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/nbc">here</a> regarding the
existing CLI.) On the upside, NanoBlogger is a CLI system which
makes it easy to modify.</p>
<p>I started out with a few small helper scripts, eventually
merging them into a single helper script. As I was using that
script and learning more about NanoBlogger, I found myself writing
smaller helper scripts for my big helper script. Eventually, I was
never calling my original, large helper script directly.</p>
<p>At this point it became clear that some refactoring was needed.
So I refactored. I came up with a single shell script call
<i>nbc.sh</i> that does all the work and a series of shell scripts
that simply call nbc.sh.</p>
<p>The key idea behind nbc.sh, or simply <i>nbc</i>, is that the
scripts that call it are trivial. By "trivial" I mean that each
script is only a few lines long, all the side scripts have
identical content, and, if not for the semantics of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>, would simply
be multiple symbolic links to the same program.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the code for the side scripts simply
stores the command name, <i>$0</i>, of the side script that was
called and then calls the <i>nbc.sh</i> script that is in the same
directory as the side script.</p>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh

# Code to load include file.
ORIG_ARG_0="$0"
NBDIR=${0%/*}
. ${NBDIR}/nbc.sh
</pre>
<p>This means that as I continue to add functionality to nbc, all I
need to do is copy one of the side scripts to the filename of the
new command I added.</p>
<p>While I won't discuss the exact naming scheme used for these
side scripts in detail in this posting, I will say that I have
tried to systematic in how the scripts are named. Once you learn a
few abbreviations (eg: "e" for "Entry" or "Entries", "u" for
"Update") and the rules for combining those abbreviations (standard
<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation">RPN</a>),
you will know the names of all the commands, what each command
does, and the type and order of arguments each command takes.</p>
<p>I still need to write richer documentation for nbc and its side
scripts, but I can finish this posting off with some concrete
examples.</p>
<p>NB supports an "update" command that essentially tells NB to
rebuild the blog from scratch. The syntax of this command is:</p>
<pre class="example">
nb update
</pre>
<p>My nbc version of this command is:</p>
<pre class="example">
nbu
</pre>
<p>All of the commands for nbc start with the letters "nb". The
letter "U" is the abbreviation for "Update". So "nbu" tells nb to
run the update command. As I said, the code for nbu and the other
side scripts are trivial and given above. As far as examples go,
nbu is not very exciting. But the nbc's CLI for creating tags is a
bit more exciting.</p>
<p>NB's syntax for creating tags, as documented in its manual,
is:</p>
<pre class="example">
nb --title &lt;tag-name&gt; add tag
</pre>
<p>Gosh! That's both tough to remember and tough to type. In nbc,
the command for adding a tag is <i>nbga</i>. All commands start
with "nb". After that, the "g" means that we are talking about
"taGs". The "a" stands for "Add". The syntax for the command is</p>
<pre class="example">
nbga &lt;tag list&gt;
</pre>
<p>Besides being much easier to type and remember, it allows a tag
list as compared to a single tag name. That is, you can create
multiple tags in a single command rather than needing to call nb
once for each new tag.</p>
<p>In NBC, a tag list is a comma-separated list of one or more tag
names. So "tag1" is a tag list and "tag1,tag2,tag3" is also a tag
list. If you prefer you can space-separate the tag list but you
need to ensure that you pass the entire tag list as the first
argument to nbga.</p>
<p>As the operations become more complex, NBC's simplifications
become greater and more obvious. My next posting about NBC will
discuss some of these simplifications.</p>
<p>If you wish to use NBC, look at the source code, or tell me why
NBC sucks, you can get the scripts at <a href=

This Blog Is Now Hosted For Free (and it's slashdot proof
too)</a></h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>While there are many free or nearly free blog hosting sites
available, most of them come with a long list of restrictions.
Either they restrict you to using their blogging software, throw
ads on your pages, give you the "unlimited bandwidth" plan that
they'll cut off if your site gets too much traffic, limit you to
only the ugly themes, etc…</p>
<p>But <a href=
"http://www.neilsmithline.com">www.neilsmithline.com</a> is now
hosted on a site that charges me nothing, doesn't put ads on my
pages, couldn't care less about the theme I use, and, should I ever
be lucky enough, survive <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotting">slashdotting</a>. The
only restriction is that my blog has to be static. Being that I
already had a static blog (see <a href=
"#about-this-blogs-tech.org">previous posting</a>), this was no
problem for me at all. I've used lots of dynamic blogs (<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal">Drupal</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress">WordPress</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla">Joomla</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogger</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type">Movable
Type</a>, etc…) and just found that "dynamic" is a short way of
saying that the blogging system is going to do what it wants and
not what I want.</p>
<p>Along with the free hosting I get automatic version control,
well-managed collaboration (not that I have any collaborators),
data redundancy, eternal archiving (I probably won't need it that
long but it's nice to know that nothing will get lost), and the
ability to get a copy of my data onto my local machine whenever I
want it.</p>
<p>My choice of blogging technology was largely influenced by these
two blog postings, <a href=
"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/further-jekyll-notes">1</a>
and <a href=
"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/moved-to-jekyll">2</a>, and
email conversations I had with their author, <a href=
"https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/about">Les
Orchard</a>. While Les went with <a href=
"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, I preferred the
simpler <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/">NanoBlogger</a>. Les uses
<a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> for versioning his blog
but hosts his blog on his own site as he wants full control of what
is published. I simply couldn't agree with him more.</p>
<p>When I moved to my new blogging framework, I quickly got my blog
up and running using NanoBlogger for site generation and sftp to
publish it to my VPS. Today I investigated replacing sftp with
Github and its notification framework. This would essentially
mirror Les's blog system except that I am running NanoBlogger
locally while he runs Jekyll.</p>
<p>As I was investigating using Github for transportation and
archiving of my blog, I decided to take another look at <a href=
"http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. And then, like a
lightning bolt, it occurred to me. When I publish my blog by
pushing it to Github, if the repository has the magic name of
<i>neil-smithline.github.com</i>, then Github would publish my blog
at <a href=
"http://neil-smithline.github.com/">http://neil-smithline.github.com/</a>
automatically. There simply was no benefit to serve my blog from my
VPS as Github would do it far better than I could on my VPS.</p>
<p>The only problem I foresee is that I run more than just my blog
on <a href=
"http://www.nelismithline.com">www.neilsmithline.com</a>. But the
other applications I run are only for my private use so I can just
map them to another sub-domain such as
<i>whatever.neilsmithline.com</i>. For example, I've been playing
with a cloud-based bookmarking system, <a href=
"http://www.phoboslab.org/projects/asaph">Asaph</a>, that allows
you to run your own cloud bookmark server. But I can access it at
and, if you have an interest, can view it at: <a href=
"http://www2.neilsmithline.com/asaph/">http://www2.neilsmithline.com/asaph/</a>.</p>
<p>All-in-all, it's like a nerd's dream come true :-D</p>
<p><b>UPDATED: Sat Feb 11 13:12:02 EST 2012</b><br />
There seems to be another problem with hosting my blog on Github.
While practically all of Github requires SSL, there appears to be
no way to get a Github hosted website to use SSL. Thinking about
it, the task seems inherently difficult. Github makes all of its
sources file public but you must protect your site's SSL private
key. Currently, all site information is stored in the Github
repository. A private SSL key could only be added if Github updated
their configuration to allow the key to be stored out-of-band (ie:
not in the repository).</p>

Hack I've Seen In Awhile</a></h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>I was reading about <a href=
"http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting">SL4A</a>, also known
as <a href="http://android.com">Android</a> <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">Scripting
Languages</a>. They are a set of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_and_dirty">quick-and-dirty</a>
ports of programming languages to the Android that interact with
the Android <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">OS</a>. I just
stumbled upon this "<a href=
"http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/issues/detail?id=184">issue
page</a>" (it's more like a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">forum</a> than a bug
report).</p>
<p>The developer is trying to run something on his Android, which
is basically <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, that requires
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser">superuser</a>
permissions. As the responses started to build upon each other, one
user suggested starting his shell script with the following lines
(the actual posting was in Android's flavor of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>
but I've converted it to <a href=
"http://linux.die.net/man/1/su">bash(1)</a> to make it more
accessible):</p>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$USER" != "root" ]; then
    exec sudo $SHELL -c "`cat /proc/$$/cmdline | tr '\000' ' '`" root
fi
</pre>
<p>I simply couldn't help being entertained at how revolting yet
simply brilliant that code is. I hate when I run a command and it
behaves stupidly because I didn't run it as the correct user. For
example, this is the output of running <a href=
"http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get">apt-get(8)</a> without proper
permission:</p>
<pre class="example">
$ apt-get install foobar
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
</pre>
<p>So I have to rerun the command with <a href=
"http://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo">sudo(8)</a>? I guess that makes
sense in some situations but it grates on my nerves. Including the
above lines in your shell scripts will automatically run commands
as root when you need root privileges. It will also do this without
bypassing the security of sudo. That is, if you don't have
permission to run a command with sudo, then this won't help.</p>
<p>Despite the plain hackery of the above code, I expanded upon it,
making it a full shell script utility. You can look the code or
grab a copy at my <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> <a href=
"https://github.com/Neil-Smithline">page</a> in the <a href=
"https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/rerunasroot">rerunasroot</a>
repository.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://bit.ly/Ad2VZd">this article</a>
in the Wikipedia about an annual 22-mile cross-country race where
the participants are people running and people riding horses. After
25-years the first runner won the race. In the subsequent
half-dozen years there have been several more human winners.</p>
<p>I feel bad for any runner that is drafting a horse when the
horse's tail goes up…</p>

DOA? Not Quite But Getting There</a></h3>

<p>While not dead, SOPA is losing its teeth. Despite having had its
major backer remove one of the more totalitarian portions from the
bill (the ability to block non-US DNS addresses), SOPA appears
unable to make progress in Congress.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://cnet.co/ArcHPH">CNET</a> article (via
<a href="http://bit.ly/zMTg3h">Slashdot</a>), the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA">RIAA</a> whines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of helping to come up with mechanisms to deny access to
the U.S. market by foreign criminals," the RIAA wrote, "the
opposition just keeps saying no. It is incumbent upon them to help
develop language that will ensure that criminals can't access our
market, while at the same time protecting our need for national
cybersecurity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="#SOPA-the-end-of-free-speech.org">discussed
previously</a>, SOPA claims to support American businesses while it
really supports the very large media companies and stifles smaller
companies and individuals rights to publish.</p>
<p>As I've stated in my previous <a href=
"#SOPA-the-end-of-free-speech.org">posting about SOPA</a>, I am
strongly opposed to <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy%20of%20software">piracy</a> as
I am a software engineer (ie: software pays my rent). But I also
believe that piracy can be dealt with without destroying <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech">free speech</a>.
My viewpoints are similar to those of the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation">EFF</a>
and differ from the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation">FSF</a>'s
viewpoint which opposes proprietary software altogether.</p>

<p><em>This posting is an updated version of my <a href=
"http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Neil_Smithline">user page</a>
originally posted on 6 Dec 2011.</em></p>
A few months ago I experienced what is known as a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_event_(psychological)">traumatic
event</a>.
<p>It was a day like many other days. I was talking to my two sons
and we had a disagreement about some fact. (I have no recollection
what the fact being discussed was.) So, we did what we always do.
We each reached for one of the nearby smartphones, tablets,
netbooks, and laptops that populate our lives and went right to the
<a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> to resolve the
argument.</p>
<p>Then it happened. The Wikipedia was down. For a second or two,
none of us knew what to do. Then we <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googled">Googled</a> to find the
answer to our question (I still can't remember the subject but I'm
sure I was right :-).</p>
<p>But I started thinking, what would happen if the Wikipedia were
to go away? It is not that I think the Wikipedia is perfect. In
fact, I think it is chock full of problems. But, what makes the
Wikipedia special is that the Wikipedia's problems are ours, the
users', problems. They aren't owned by <a href=
"http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2002/10/22/steal_these_buttons.html#000526">
big government</a>, <a href=
"http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2002/10/22/steal_these_buttons.html#000526">
big business</a>, <a href=
"http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2002/10/22/steal_these_buttons.html#000526">
lobbyists</a>, the <a href=
"http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2002/10/22/steal_these_buttons.html#000526">
PRC</a>, or anyone else.</p>
<p>If there's a problem, you can edit the page and fix it. If
you're uncertain what to do, you can add a comment about the
problem on the discussion page with the hope that someone else will
fix it or help you out. Or you can simply ignore it. But, in all
cases, <b>you</b> are making the decision.</p>
<p>So I donated $5 to the Wikipedia. That's about the same amount I
tip the driver who delivers my groceries.</p>
<p>Shortly after this traumatic event, the Wikipedia started
posting these banner requests for donations. Personally, I find
them increasingly annoying with every visit. But they are not
nearly as annoying as the 10 minutes or so the Wikipedia was down.
That downright spooked me.</p>
<p>Being they've continued to post the banner requests, I'm
assuming they continue to need more money. So I decided to start
what I'm calling The Wikipedia: Just Give campaign.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the campaign will consist of, but I want to
encourage everyone to give to the Wikipedia. I, who am totally
untalented in the graphic arts, even made a few icons to help
people join my campaign.</p>
<p>So I ask each of you to just give. If you don't have a lot,
don't give a lot. But more importantly, encourage everyone you know
to just give.</p>
<p><b>Update 14 January 2012:</b> Just got this</p>

Florida Appeals Court More Liberal Than SOPA!</a></h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>Earlier this week, the Florida appeals court made a ruling that
even the poster of a defamatory posting on a public website could
not force a website to remove the posting. While most sites allow
you to remove your own postings, <a href=
"http://www.ripoffreport.com/">RipoffReport.com</a>, the site
involved in this ruling, states that as an advocate of free speech,
it never removes reports. This is clearly stated at the top of
their home page and documented extensively on their <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripoff_Report#Non-removal_Policy">Wikipedia
page</a>.</p>
<p>While not allowing the poster to remove or have removed a
posting seems extreme, the site claims that it wishes to remain
unbiased. As such, it makes no judgment calls about its content.
Everything that is appropriate for the site will stay on the site,
forever. RipoffReport.com is afraid that posters may be pressured
by 3<sup>rd</sup>-parties to remove articles. As such, They are
simply not allowed to.</p>
<p>While postings are never removed, the site allows anyone to post
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuttal">rebuttal</a> to
any posting. A poster can use this mechanism to retract their
initial statement.</p>
<p>The court ruled that RipoffReport.com could neither be held
liable for the defamatory posting nor be forced to remove it. The
bottom line of all of this is that</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p>The supreme court of Florida, a <a href=
"http://www.gallup.com/poll/125066/State-States.aspx">middle-of-the-road
state</a>, was willing to make a controversial ruling favored many
aspects of freedom of speech. If SOPA is passed, cases like this
won't even make it to courts as SOPA make it clear that if a ruling
is defamatory, it is illegal.</p>
</div>
<p>While Congress has delayed voting on SOPA for another month, it
is still on the docket. It is unclear what the fate of SOPA will
be.</p>
<p>One can hope that Congress pays attention to protests such as
the statement]] consumers sent to <a href=
"http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> after it announced its support
of SOPA. GoDaddy announced that on a Saturday (see <a href=
"http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/12/29/2053252/wikipedia-to-dump-godaddy-over-sopa">
more complete chronology</a>) and then lost <a href=
"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/12/25/1452251/go-daddy-loses-over-21000-domains-in-one-daylosing">
21K domains</a> on the next day. More recently, the <a href=
"http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/12/29/2053252/wikipedia-to-dump-godaddy-over-sopa">
Wikipedia announced it would discontinue all use of
GoDaddy</a>.</p>
<p>Let's continue to hope that advocates of free speech, including
you (see <a href=
"SOPA-the-end-of-free-speech.html#ID-06BB29E4-D6B3-430E-B5A3-FDC6716A0ED3">
SOPA: The End Of Free Speech</a> for instructions as to how to
help), continue to pressure our government into sane activit</p>
<p>Copied directly from the <a href=
"http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> <a href=
"http://bit.ly/vVVDLC">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/">RipoffReport.com</a>
contained an admittedly defamatory posting, by one of its users,
about a person who operated a Florida corporation providing
addiction treatment services. Although the site was asked by the
poster herself to remove the post, it refused. A Florida appeals
court has ruled that the site is absolutely immune from suit
(<a href=
"http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2011/12/florida-appeals-court-rules.html">pdf</a>),
and cannot even be directed to remove the offending post, since
under the
[[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode47/usc<sub>sec</sub><sub>47</sub><sub>00000230</sub>-—000-.html][Communications
Decency Act (47 USC 230)] 'no cause of action may be brought'
against a provider of an "interactive computer service" based upon
information provided by a 3rd party.</p>

"./archives/2011/12/28/the_litigious_trio/">The Litigious
Trio</a></h3>
<div class="item-description"><!-- NANOBLOGGER METADATA - END -->
<!-- The posting body follows this END_HTML directive -->
<p>This posting is best viewed as part of the series of postings
about <a href=
"http://neilsmithline.com/archives/litigious-trio/index.html">The
Litigious Trio</a> and, in a larger context, <a href=
"http://neilsmithline.com/archives/online-freedom/index.html">Online
Freedom</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, <i>The Litigious Trio</i> are, in alphabetical
order, <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href=
"http://google.com">Google</a> and <a href=
"http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. While they are three
wonderful technology companies, over time, each has turned to an
increasingly large amount of litigation to enforce their current
market status.</p>
<p>While I do not believe that the three companies actively
collaborate with each other to hinder the success of smaller
companies, I believe that selfish<sup><a class="footref" name=
"fnr.1" href="#fn.1" id="fnr.1">1</a></sup> business practices by
the trio have had the affect of having created a three company
monopoly<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2" id=
"fnr.2">2</a></sup>. While the three companies are locked in a
near-endless stream of litigation against each other, this is
rather typical amongst large corporate competitors. I can't say
that I'm in favor of such litigation but I the three companies can
spend their money that way if they want to. They have more than
enough of it.</p>
<p>But when <i>The Litigious Trio</i>, behaving in a
pseudo-monopolistic manner, use litigation to block competition
from smaller companies, they end up stifling innovation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <i>The Litigious Trio</i> are not necessarily the
most user-friendly companies. They, along with <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>, are some of
the leaders in gathering information about its users. Consider the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly all of Google's revenue comes from advertising. Their
advertising is so valuable, and profitable, because they are able
to sell well targeted ads. That is, they know so much about each
user that they can sell ad space for that specific user for more
than other advertising vendors. The article, <a href=
"http://www.globalreports.com/?article=12">We Are Google's
Products</a>, provides a good summary of this concept.</li>
<li>Google has a near-monopoly on internet advertising. The US
Senate <a href=
"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/12/21/1356246/senators-recommend-ftc-perform-antitrust-investigation-of-google">
has recently requested</a> the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission">FTC</a> to
investigate this.</li>
<li>Microsoft's <a href=
"https://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft+antitrust&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&amp;client=firefox-a">
monopolistic practices</a> have been discussed and challenged by
courts around the world for years.</li>
<li>Apple is currently under investigation for <a href=
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/07/us-justice-department-apple-ebooks_n_1134983.html">
price fixing on its eBooks</a>, has just been fined for <a href=
"http://www.pluggedin.co.uk/article/apple-fined-over-misleading-customers-italy">
charging customers in Italy</a> for providing federally mandated,
free support, and has tried to <a href=
"http://apple.slashdot.org/story/11/08/09/1832254/sale-of-samsung-galaxy-tab-blocked-in-the-eu">
destroy Samsung's mobile market</a> by presenting <a href=
"http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/08/15/1758224/flawed-evidence-in-eu-apple-vs-samsung-case">
falsified evidence</a> to courts around the world. While this last
claim seems hard to believe, an <a href=
"http://www.pcworld.com/article/238047/apple_offers_flawed_evidence_in_lawsuit_against_samsung.html">
easily accessible description and images</a> demonstrate that Apple
is either incompetent or dishonest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only question seems to be whether the public is motivated to
address this problem and what the public can do to address it. The
reason monopolies are illegal is because fighting them is
difficult.</p>

Sparkleshare: Maybe An Open, Privately Hosted, Dropbox
Alternative</a></h3>
<div class="item-description">
<p><a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> took the internet by
storm with its free storage and ease of access. But Dropbox comes
with a limited amount of data, a level of secureness that is
hard-to-understand, and rather proprietary.</p>
<p><a href="http://sparkleshare.org">Sparkleshare</a> is an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software">
open source</a> alternative to Dropbox that hit my radar screen
about 6 months ago. I played with it a bit back then but it didn't
seem to be quite there. I think I was using an early-alpha,
pre-release version so I this was to be expected.</p>
<p>I gave it another try earlier this week and seem to be pretty
happy with it. Some of the things I like about it include:</p>
<ol>
<li>I get to host it on my own server. This means the data is
private. I own it. Nobody else has a copy of it. Etc…</li>
<li>I have been renting a Linux <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> from
<a href="http://rosehosting.com">RoseHosting.com</a> ($20/month)
for many years so they provide me with a convenient, managed, and
relatively secure place to host Sparkleshare.</li>
<li>It only took me about 5 minutes to install and configure
sparkleshare on my Linux VPS. Not because I'm brilliant but because
Linux doesn't suck and Sparkleshare requires no special server
software. Just a few standard packages such as <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> and a
copy-and-paste of one command line. The client install (Mac OS X)
was equally simple.</li>
<li>Being that it is <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software">FOSS</a>,
there is continual scrutiny of the source code to maintain quality
and security.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only real objection I have with it is that Dropbox allows
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symbolic
links</a> in the Dropbox folder so I don't need to have all of my
files in one directory. I haven't yet gotten this to work on
Sparkleshare. Either I just haven't figured it out, someone else
will add it shortly, or, being it is <a href=
"http://www.wikipedia.com/Foss">FOSS</a>, I'll add it if I get
motivated enough (BTW: I'm voting for someone else implementing
it).</p>

Of Free Speech</a></h3>

<p><a href=
"https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8173">
SOPA</a>, and its sister bill PROTECT-IP, are currently making
their way through congress. I have pointers to some of the
excellent sources of information on the bills at the end of this
article.</p>
<p>While the magnitude of these bills is staggering, this posting
focuses on how the passage of these bills will dramatically remove
the ability of individuals to produce and share content on the
internet.</p>
<p>While I favor reasonable enforcement and punishment of
internet-based crimes, these bills introduce the concepts of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Guilty until proven innocent</b></li>
<li><b>Guilty by association</b></li>
<li><b>Whoopsy daisy legal recourse</b> that restricts damages (eg:
going bankrupt) due to abuse of SOPA to "s— happens" response.</li>
</ul>
<p>into American law. At least to me, those concepts don't seem
very "American".</p>
<p>The problems with this bill can best be demonstrated by a simple
example. Let us use the consider a fictitious, non-profit website
run by a couple of friends that is focused on internet freedom. The
website is called <i>Big Brother, Back-off and Stop-It!</i> with
the URL BBBandS.org.</p>
<p>If this bill is passed, <i>Big Brothers Big Sisters</i>
(<a href="http://bbbs.org">http://bbbs.org</a>) could simply write
a letter to search engines such as Google, content distributors
such as Facebook, and payment companies such as Paypal, claiming
that they feel BBBandS.org is infringing on their <i>domain
name</i>. Once this is done, <i>each</i> search, content, and
payment provider must contact BBBandS.org (remember that
BBBandS.org is a couple of friends working out of their
garage).</p>
<p>BBBandS.org must reply to each and every provider explaining why
they do not feel that BBBandS.org is infringing on BBBS.org's
<i>domain name</i>. It seems clear that BBBandS.org could not
accomplish this task in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>For each company that BBBandS.org does not manage to provide a
credible counterclaim to (where <i>credible</i> is determined by
the search, content, and payment provider companies), a fairly
mechanical process will begin where federal courts will execute a
<i>cease and desist</i> to each search, content, or payment service
provider informing them that they must stop servicing
BBBandS.org.</p>
<p><b>Guilty until proven innocent:</b> Note that the simple lack
of a timely response to sufficient to, by means of a judicial
<i>cease and desist</i> order, force search, and payment providers
to become legally and financially liable if they continue to do
business with BBBandS.org.</p>
<p><b>Guilty by association:</b> Whether a service provider agrees
or disagrees with the order, they can be held accountable if they
do not "block access to or end financial affiliation" with
BBBandS.org.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, the bill goes on to provide "immunity
from liability for service providers" that follow a <i>cease and
desist</i> order, causing clear economic harm to BBBandS.org,
<b>even</b> if it is eventually determined that there was no
infringement.</p>
<p><b>Whoopsy daisy legal recourse</b>: Should the <i>cease and
desist</i> order be determined to be incorrect via a legal process
that may take years and cost more money than most people will ever
have, this bill restricts BBBandS.org's legal recourse to accepting
the apologies of the US judicial system.</p>
<p>While I am in favor of what the bill claims to be protecting,
this bill proposes far too high a price to pay for that
protection.</p>
<p>If you care about the rights of small organizations (eg: people
like you), please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read an excellent summary of SOPA in this <a href=

article</a>. Keep in mind that the reason that the article seems
ludicrous, insane, and unbelievable is because it is accurately
reflecting the proposed legislation.</li>
<li>Google <i>SOPA</i> or <i>PROTECT-IP</i>.</li>
<li>Take action via Mozilla's page <a href=
"http://bit.ly/tvIpE3">focused on this issue</a>.</li>
<li>Take action via the <a href=

EFF</a>.</li>
<li>Contact your legislator using <a href=
"http://bit.ly/s0I5me">this</a> <a href=
"#OpenCongress.org">OpenCongress.org</a> page (takes only a minute
or so).</li>
<li>Discuss this issue with everyone you know.</li>
<li>Discuss this issue with people you don't know. I recommend "So
what do you think about SOPA?" as a pick-up line though I encourage
creativity and individualism as to the exact wording.</li>
<li>Post a copy or a link to one or more articles on SOPA
everywhere you can.</li>

<p><a href="http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net">NanoBlogger</a>
supports <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">tags</a>. While they
came working out of the box, their UI is a bit awkward. I now have
it so that I can easily tag entries with just a single command
line. For example, I'll tag this posting by typing: nbeta
about-this-blogs-tech 1 <code>nbeta</code> is my shell script to
add tags to an entry. It seems a bit hard to remember but:</p>
<table style=
'border: 2px solid black !important; border-collapse: separate;'
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="all" frame="2">
<colgroup>
<col class="left" />
<col class="left" />

<thead>

<td class="left">a</td>
<td class="left">Add</td>
<td class="left">We'll be adding tags</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><code>about-this-blogs-tech</code> is the tag name.
<code>1</code> is the entry ID number. I'd like it to be the entry
name but that isn't done yet and seems of lower priority as the
newest entry is always entry #1.</p>

Works</a></h3>
<div class="item-description">
<p>Well, it appears this actually does work. I seem to be having a
few issues integrating with <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net">NanoBlogger</a> but I'm sure
I'll work those out. The problems that I've seen are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It seems that adding or even updating a new entry is as costly
as rebuilding the entire blog from scratch. Right now, that's OK.
But what am I going to do when I have 10, or 100 postings? I hope
NanoBlogger can handle this.</li>
<li>NB seems to assume that its input files are hand-written in
some legacy text editor called <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>
or something :-). While my strategy of using <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>' <a href=
"http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> keeps the flavor of NB in that it
is written in a simple markup language, it doesn't seem to fit the
NB model perfectly. There is nothing wrong with NB's markup, it is
just that Org Mode's markup can easily be exported to virtually
every other markup on the planet. So I just need to learn Org Mode
markup, write my content in Org Mode, and then publish that data
into whatever format I choose. Seems a better solution but NB isn't
quite prepared for it.</li>
<li>I would still like better integration with Org Mode and NB. The
steps I've used to produce this entry are:
<ul>
<li>Ran a little shell script I wrote to create a new NB entry. All
I do is give the shell script the title of the Org Mode file I want
to store the new entry in and it does its magic, leaving me with an
Org Mode skeleton for NB.</li>
<li>Edit the Org Mode file just created.</li>
<li>Use Org Mode to publish the entry. This just stores it in my
local NB folder.</li>
<li>Run <code>nb update</code> to have my changes put into the
local copy of the blog.</li>
<li>Run <code>nb preview</code> to view the changes before
publishing.</li>
<li>Run <code>nb publish</code> to update my blog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, while they're are still some problems, I have to say I love
it. The advantages of using Org Mode and the simple NB blogging
engine on both my local and production server is way cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> is actually way cool.
I've only started using it in the past year and will likely spend
years learning it as it supports so many features. But, like all
well-designed pieces of software, you don't need to learn it all at
once. I'll yabber about Org Mode another day. In any case, I'm real
happy with my blog and the ease with which I can add postings to
it.</p>

Technology</a></h3>

<p>My hope is that I can write this entry in <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>' <a href=
"http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> and have it auto-published into
this <a href="http://www.neilsmithline.com">blog</a>. If you are
reading this, then I have succeeded.</p>
<p>This is a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website#Static_website">static
blog</a>. That is, the server side is all <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>. It can be served by
virtually any web server. This makes it incredibly convenient for
testing and deploying. When I am writing blog entries, I'm just
typing in Emacs. I then save the entries and use Org Mode plus some
personalized tweaks to <a href=
"http://orgmode.org/org.html#Publishing">publish</a> them to a
local directory as something close to HTML.</p>
<p>These HTMLish files are then fed into <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net">NanoBlogger</a>. NanoBlogger
is the magic tool that turns a few HTMLish files into a fully
functional website. NanoBlogger accepts HTML for the text af
entries but wants some simply formatted <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> added to the
file.</p>
<p>The Metadata is needed to help NanoBlogger out because, as its
name implies, is a teeny-tiny blog engine. As a comparison, my
installation of NanoBlogger is 768K (yes, that's "K"). I also have
installations of Drupal at (14M) and Joomla (107M).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.txt">.txt</a> source
for each NanoBlogger posting is a file with the body of the entry
in HTML embedded but all the cruft that tends to come before and
after the body of a web page is simply not there. The easiest way
to get an understanding of it is to view the <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/articles/example.txt">metadata
source</a> for this <a href=
"http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/articles/example/">sample
posting</a>.</p>
<p>So you're saying "Big deal." or "Who needs yet another file
format?" But it is a big deal. What most <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younglings#Ranks_of_Jedi">younglings</a>
have never learned is that <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> is a distraction
from actual content production. Content production is not the same
as formatting and editing and, at least in my experience, uses very
different parts of the brain. So the less formatting you do while
producing content, the better your content will be (at least if you
have my brain :-).</p>
<p>While it has largely been lost with the popularization of the
<a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, initially, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cheatsheet">Wiki markup</a>
was intended to simplify editing but also served to separate the
content production from formatting. While NanoBlogger expects these
HTMLish files as input, it is designed to generate them from any
number of simpler input formats.</p>
<p>These simpler input formats are quite unlike HTML as they are,
well they're simpler. The default input format is the rather famous
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
though many other formats are supported by NanoBlogger or the
community. This <a href=
"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/use-markdown-for-easy-web-writing.html">
article</a> seems to do a good job explaining the benefits of
simple languages such as Markdown.</p>
<p>It took me but a few hours to create a converter for <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>' <a href=
"http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> to NanoBlogger.</p>
<p>While not nearly as <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_(aesthetic)">cool</a> as what
I've discussed above NanoBlogger has yet another advantage: it
produces a static site. On my local machine (<a href=
"http://support.apple.com/kb/SP546">17" MacBook Pro</a>), I can
view the entire site without running a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web server</a>. I simply
go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">Firefox</a>
(actually <a href=
"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/">Firefox Aurora</a>)
and visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URL</a>,
specifically, the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_url">file URL</a> of my blog.
For me, I visit <code>file://Users/neil/www-nb</code>, and then I
can see my entire blog through the magic of a static websites,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_url">file URLs</a>, and
<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_URL#Absolute_and_relative_URLs">
relative URLs</a>.</p>
